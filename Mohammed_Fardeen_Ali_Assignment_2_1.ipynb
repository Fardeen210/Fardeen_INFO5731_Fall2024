            "Review: 12th fail- THE BEST MOVIE OF 2023, period!This is a perfect example of how to take a movie with a strong and inspiring storyline based on true events. It portrays the crowd who has perseverance and never die attitude in pursuing civil services examination (UPSC) exams to eventually become IAS or IPS.Vidhu Vinod Chopra is a master story teller, and he sure knows to have the right blend of dialogue delivery with sensibility and delicacy.The \"HUG\" definition is shown as real and you can feel it.Screenplay is terrific with a touch of brilliance.Vikrant Massey's acting is a benchmark and he embodies it with full of life. His emotions, innocence, anger and happiness can be truly felt as he takes us through his tough journey to the pinnacle.Medha Shankar provides strong support for Vikrant. Their purest love, chemistry and just being there for one another when it's really needed is worth to withhold in your memory for a long time.Anant Joshi is the real friend one can wish for in their lifetime. Aisa dost sabko milna chahiye.Climax is multiple times clap worthy.10x respect for all those who pursued UPSC exams, tried multiple times and never lost hope. 100x respect for those who cleared the interview and serving for the government as the key administrators, and taking the country forward.This movie is a big inspiration for kids and future generation. It teaches them and us that life can be restarted multiple times and can bounce back stronger.12th FAIL is a BIG PASS with distinction (Rank 1, 100/100, GPA 4.0).\n",

Keep doing such films.Simple story-telling, no bollywood masala and reality at its peak. Vidhu Vinod Chopra has done justice with the script. This is the difference between experienced director and know it all \"directors\". Yes, I am talking about TVF guys. 2 seasons and they literally have made a mockery of IAS struggle. They should watch this and learn from the best.I just hope now that Vikrant gets a best actor award for this. He deserves it.That \"restart\" song is gonna stay in my mind for long. And yeah huge round of applause at the end in the theatre. Go and watch it, please!\n",

The story has been told in such a heartwarming way that the audience is totally involved in this inspiring story of grit, determination and victory against all odds. The performances are award worthy. Vikram Massey is outstanding in the lead role and is well supported by the rest of the cast. The direction, screenplay and editing are top notch. Unfortunately in India the over the top and illogical films become blockbusters and the really outstanding films don't do well commercially. I hope the Indian audience views such films as it will encourage film makers to do top quality work of international standards. This film falls in category that the Hindi film industry should feel proud of.\n",

            "Review: \"12th Fail\" is a masterpiece that transcends celluloid, a testament to Vidhu Vinod Chopra's unparalleled storytelling prowess. Through vivid characters, evocative visuals, profound writing, and a soul-stirring soundtrack, he crafts a narrative that resonates deeply. Vikrant Massey's portrayal of Manoj Kumar Sharma is a tour de force, embodying a range of emotions that leave an indelible mark. Priyanshu Chatterjee's portrayal of the upright police officer adds a layer of authenticity and bravery to the story. The film's exploration of discrimination and resilience is both powerful and poignant, shedding light on the stark choices faced by the marginalized. In every frame, Mr. Vinod Chopra's artistry shines through, turning moments into magic.\"12th Fail\" stands as a 147-minute gem, a cinematic triumph that both impresses and inspires. Kudos to the maestro for his stellar direction and dedication to excellence.Undoubtedly, 12th Fail passes with an immense Distinction. Yes! 12th Fail is a Triumph of Unyielding Spirit.The cinematic expression in question showcases a remarkable portrayal of characters, bringing them to life in a way that blurs the lines between fiction and reality. The depth and authenticity of the performances make it seem as though the characters are not played by actors, but rather by genuine individuals. Given the outstanding work by Vikrant Massey, it would be a profound oversight if he were not recognized with a National Award for his exceptional contribution to this piece of art.Just sharing yet again... Vidhu Vinod Chopra, a cinematic maestro, weaves stories that resonate deep within. His canvas is vast, painting emotions, breathing life into characters, and etching unforgettable moments. Each frame is a testament to his artistry, where passion meets purpose, unfolding like a symphony of emotions. A true cinematic alchemist, Mr. Vinod turns moments into magic, leaving an indelible mark on Indian cinema.\n",

When he cracks the UPSC interview and starts crying, you feel so proud of him, and makes you so emotional!Nobody could do Manoj the way Vikrant did!

            "Review: 12th fail is a bigraphical drama film directed by vidhu vinod chopra.I cannot explain to you what level of performance i have seen from vikrant massey. Its national award worthy. His every expression, dialogue delivery, mannerism, everything was pitch perfect. When he broke down in the final scene out of happiness, a piece of heart smiled. This actor deserves all the accolades. Another actor to applaud is medha shankar. First of all, I could not take my eyes off her, she is that pretty. And her peforamance was prettier. Her dialogue delivery and expression is on point. Anshuman pushkar plays the sandeep bhaiya, sad at his peers' misery and joyous at their success. I guess we all deserve a shraddha and gauri bhaiya in our lives, if we ever have the courage to go through what manoj kumar sir had to.The writing is brilliant, and nothing else. The characters it sets up is outstanding. We feel for them, smile and laugh at their success, break down when they break down, thats the example of finest writing. The screenplay is engaging, despite taking care of very minute details. The editing of the film is sharp, the way it captures the mindspace of manoj's first impression of mukherjeenagar is brilliant. The cinematography is brilliant, hand held shots, long shots, the use of real locations gives us the authentic feel that yes, the characters are real, the world is real, the struggle is real.The social commentary on our education system and its flaws is criticised severely. Every person has a different struggle, you have to fight through it. This is a very special film, if you feel, watch it in theatres, it deserves more love.\n",

Maybe not 9.2 good, but still good.I liked the fact that it is based on two real people, and there were photos of them during the end credits.The acting, dialogue, scenery, editing, music, editing and plot were all well done. I got sucked in, emotionally, and everything felt real. That's the difference (for me, anyway) between something I'm going to stick around for, verses something I bail from in the first few minutes.Not much more to say. Didn't expect my eyes to well up at the end, b/c I'm not usually that way. But it happened.Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.\n",

An apparently ideal individual, who according to the film, only sleeps three hours per day and works/studies the rest; fails in all his UPSC attempts except for the last and even then, goes on to completely derail his interview before you guessed it, magically passing. Standard melodrama that has been done to death. Add in a love angle, some corruption angle and you have a film. The film also tries to tangle you in with emotional melodrama but in the end, feels all kind of soapy.I couldn't care what happened to the main character, because well, the director made it clear from the get go. The acting's decent but that alone doesn't make it clear why this film is rated so high. I have seen tons of Hindi films that are much superior to this and honestly, this is skewing the rating trend a lot.\n",

The fact that it is based on a true story makes you really understand and appreciate what the person went through and how he achieved it. Dadi is awesome 😎Vikrant Massey plays the character with such ease. Do read how he prepared for the movie. It reminds me of Aamir Khan. Medha Shankar, Anshumaan Pushkar, Anant Joshi have portrayed their roles beautifully.The storyline flows effortlessly from the beginning and the narration by Anant is superb. What you also live through is the hard work that people put in while preparing for the UPSC exams, especially those coming from far flung villages of the country.A movie that you would definitely want the kids in the family to see.

            "Review: This movie is such an inspirational-realistic and depicted with cast full of natural talent. Hats off to Vikrant Massey for portraying a practical and real character. One should watch this movie in nearby theatres so that more such kind of movies are made in the future.It's trailer itself is eyepleasing, but believe me the entire movie is much beyond the trailer and the fact that it's based on true events make it one of the finest movies in the Indian cinema.It's a must watch movie for all the youths despite the fact that you are preparing for UPSC or not. You'll get to know that reasons for not putting proper efforts in your preparation for anything is not the things you tell to others it's just inside yourself. If you decide to do something then you'll definitely achieve it with positive mindset. All these things are depicted much better than the words I wrote here.\n",

After watching this movie I am very greatful to doctor Kartik.However I do not prefer to watch a typical Bollywood movie but this one is a quite different, we just call it a masterpiece.If you think this is a movie about some boring UPSC preparation or something like that then you are extremely wrong this is not what you think after listening first time it's a way more different what you think.\n",

            "Review: 12th Fail emerges as a beacon of audacity in an era dominated by glossy yet shallow cinema. In a landscape cluttered with overhyped sagas like Kashmir Files and Kerala Story, this film dares to break free. It not only inspires but serves as a much-needed morale boost for countless dreamers, prompting deep contemplation after viewing.With impeccable direction and a stellar performance by Vikrant Massey, the movie stands tall as a testament to genuine storytelling. Kudos to Vikrant Massey and Vidhu Vinod Chopra for crafting a pure, personal, and courageous masterpiece, a rarity in today's Bollywood.This raw and unfiltered tale defies the clichés of commercial cinema, offering a refreshing departure from the norm. Depicting the arduous journey of a UPSC aspirant, it delves into the enduring struggle, resilience, and the final day of reckoning. Every actor and actress, under the brilliant direction, seamlessly aligns the narrative, creating a deeply resonant experience for Indian viewers and beyond.Bold, Raw, Unfiltered, and Real\" aptly captures the essence of this film. 12th Fail not only deserves an audience but also reaffirms the craving cinephiles have for cinema that truly respects their intellect. Vikrant Massey once again delivers a masterclass in acting, solidifying his position as a stalwart in the industry.\n",

The protagonist has the exact same expression in every scene: an annoying grin.Also, it is slow. Really slow. Editing is poor with lengthy and unnecessary pauses. Same with the dialogue... excessive pauses.Photography is beautiful, creative use of sound in transitions too...Would not recommend. This is not a 9 star movie. Ratings must be 99% from india.\n",

            "Review: Wow! This is one of the rare movies that actually made me cry. Tears were rolling down my cheek by the end of the movie and head was heavy with dizziness. Keeping philosophy of the movie aside, as far the cinema is concerned, it was an absolute brilliant. I would say that not only Vikrant Massey but all of the actors did phenomenal work. The innocence of Medha Shankar is enough to make anyone fall in love with her. BGM could have been a little better. Cinematography is nice and overall, movie sticks to realistic plane.The story that shows the story of struggle and success touches you deep within. You feel for the character since the beginning and celebrate his success as if he were your peer. The bonding the character manages to develop is amazing. We want him to succeed. And at the end, when he indeed successes, what a beautiful scene it was. The way both he and Shraddha rolls down crying. The way Manoj goes back to Dushyant and thanks him, the way he calls his mother, the way his father feels proud. It was all so great.Another scene that stuck with me was, when a character fails his 6th attempt, he opens his tea stall and start guiding others. It was so easy for the director to show that he committed suicide, after all the buildup that the movie attributed to him. But it was a nice gesture. But then there is a scene where that tea wala bhaiyya lectures the English medium student. That felt a bit too over the top and unnecessary.Romanticise upsc\n",

            "English medium look down uponNow coming to philosophy, this is where I have got some problems with the movie. In my eyes, the movie unnecessarily romanticises UPSC and works as a motivation detox. I am not a huge advocate of motivation industry myself. So, I didn't find the motivational undertone very becoming of the movie. The movie stresses that one should never give up and should always restart and that is all fine, but without a proper subject and rational of thought, this becomes just blind motivation.Then, the whole subplot about honesty. I guess the movie handled it nicely and neither became a cynic nor too preachy. I thing I didn't like that the movie glorified the poor while showing a negative sentiment for the English medium privileged kids. Honestly, I am quite fed up of this constant undertone in all Bollywood movies. Indeed the poor ones who makes lot of struggle to make ends meet and yet continue their battle deserve our utmost respect, but if the means to glorify them is to look down upon the privileged ones by showing the stereotypical rich rude kids, I don't think it's justifiable. Both rich and the poor has got despicable people that has nothing to do with their economical status. So, I didn't find it very welcoming from a director of the intelligence of VVC.Keeping these nitpicks aside, this is indeed a very well made movie glowing with the extravaganza of heroism. If you liked superheroes in your childhood, this is the one movie you should look up to.\n",

I gather, 12th Fail is well on the way to becoming a financial success too.12th Fail is a big pass with distinction. It impresses and inspires. It is a cinematic triumph that excels in every department.Vidhu Vinod Chopra's artistry shines through in every frame, turning moments into magic. He's a master story-teller. Writing and Directing a film after many years, with aplomb and ease. Film-making runs in his veins. He understands every facet of the medium.Right from the start of the movie Sarita Joshi, as Dadi, sets the pace and tenor of the film when she censures the daroga who comes with the suspension notice.Vikrant Massey is mostly good in whichever role he plays. But this portrayal of real-life IPS Officer Manoj Kumar Sharma demands more. And he rises to the occasion and how! He takes us through a tornado of emotions from innocence, anger, dexterity, happiness and more. Medha Shankar provides strong support. As do the entire ensemble of actors. Not one of them looks out-of-place or miscast.Special mention for cinematographer Rangarajan Ramabadran who makes fluid use of the camera, that's unseen in Hindi films.The anthem, Restart, lingers on for a long time. We expect no less from Shantanu Moitra who has also created the background score.We as cinephiles deserve cinema that respects us. It's about time.\n",

Strangely (because there is no relation with the story line), it reminded me of the same feeling which Rang De Basanti gave me - the feeling of fresh storytelling, the want to tell anybody and everybody to see this movie and the need to act. Also, 3 idiots has some parallels but equivalent in terms of being a game-changer.Overall, the movie is a 5 star, 4 star at worst. The KING is the script/story and writing followed by great direction and acting. No BS, just good storytelling.All in all if you're reading the review before watching the movie- Just watch it if you're up for an uplifting, very well executed, balanced movie.MUST WATCH, won't disappoint. I lowkey regret not watching the movie in theaters and contributing to the box office collections...but it is easier to cry and enjoy your emotions at the comfort of your homes :D.

It's about one guy studying really hard and facing adversity to get what he wants, and feels very matter of fact/paint by numbers for anyone who's familiar with this kind of underdog story. I just didn't feel like any part of it really excelled or made it stand out, and it was 2.5 hours of mostly decent stuff... of course, with that runtime, the film did end up feeling overlong, given the simplicity of the story.Visually, there were some interesting longer takes early on, but it ended up feeling flat as it went along, besides the scenery. There's also at least one really bad zoom where they clearly zoomed in on a frame in post-production; it looked comically bad.Music was good in parts, but a bit repetitive.\n",

And not to mention, the kind of believability and conviction they bring through their performances is quite admirable.However, my only complaint lies in the inconsistencies of the screenplay, particularly during crucial junctures.

This cinematic masterpiece left me in awe, but what struck me even more was the nearly empty movie hall. It made me reflect on the mindset of people in today's world of cinema.In an age where commercial movies with massive budgets and star-studded casts often dominate the box office, it's not uncommon to see lesser-known, yet profoundly moving films like \"12th Fail\" struggle to find their audience. This stark contrast reveals the current mindset of moviegoers, where glitz and glamour sometimes overshadow the real essence of storytelling.\"12th Fail\" features actors who may not be household names, but their performances are nothing short of outstanding. It's a testament to the fact that talent can shine without the need for famous faces. The movie, set against the backdrop of the protagonist's journey to becoming an IPS officer, is a compelling narrative that combines elements of determination, struggle, and triumph.The almost empty theater on the day I watched \"12th Fail\" left me pondering why such a brilliant piece of cinema wasn't receiving the attention it truly deserved.

The power of cinema lies in its ability to move us, make us think, and inspire us to see the world in a different light.So, let's take a moment to celebrate and champion films like \"12th Fail.\" Let's remember that a lack of star power doesn't equate to a lack of substance.

            "Review: Came into 12th Fail with low expectations given the lack of marketing and hype around the film. Boy was I wrong. The movie is an earnest telling of a true story that really speaks to the power of try try again. Vikrant Massey puts in a very strong performance as Manoj Kumar Sharma and really makes the audience empathize with the plight of the character and the unfair rigged system that he is up against. Special mention for Medha Shankar an actress that I was not familiar with but put in a very good showing so I am sure we will see her in more mainstream movies in the future. Definitely worth a watch for the whole family.\n",

            "Review: This is a movie of journey of a man hailing from a village in Morena, near Gwalior in MP. The portrayal, the journey as well as the set up is too realistic. The cinematography, BGM are all top notch. All characters are brilliantly written & acted. Leading lady Medha Shankar is absolutely brilliant with proper emotions. But the movie has the biggest star in form of Vikrant Massey. He lives the character. Be it the scenes of helplessness in village or in Delhi, he's too good. The scenes in Flour mill are too emotional & brilliantly enacted. There's no preachiness yet strikes the right notes. Vidhu Vinod Chopra you have created a masterpiece. This one is your best work ever including Parinda & easily the best movie this year & probably of last 2/3 years.\n",

            "Review: I'm overwhelmed with emotions witnessing the cinematic masterpiece, 12th Fail. This film not only made me shed tears of joy and made me proud that the entire world is watching this profound narrative.The cast, led by the remarkable Vikrant Massey, delivered an impeccable performance. Massey's commitment to authenticity and flawless execution brought the character to life in an extraordinary way. The movie's pivotal moments were skillfully portrayed.It's a cinematic gem that deserves global attention. I confidently rate it a solid 9/10. Although it is near-flawless the reason for withholding a perfect 10 is - As a theater actor with a background in filmmaking, script writing, and screenplay, I recognize the immense complexity of the role and the depth it demands.Vikrant Massey's portrayal was nothing short of sensational, marking a pinnacle in his career. His ability to navigate the character's highs and lows with intensity showcased his true talent. However, some nuances, like the dialogue delivery from a microphone, slightly detracted from the overall immersive experience. In theater too, we deliver dialogues before our stage performance over the mic. However, we have to have that intensity and feel the characters within. It felt missing in a couple of intense scenes although the acting was top-notch. Secondly, the interview scene could have been much better, instead was enhanced with a touch more drama.Despite these minor points, my love for 12th Fail, Vikrant Massey and the real couple remains resolute. Vikas Divyakirti's presence, a legend in his own, added an extra layer of brilliance to this captivating story.12th Fail is a profound journey that should resonate with audiences worldwide and stands as ONE OF THE GREATEST FILMS EVER MADE.\n",

Unlike the subject which could seem dry and unrelated to many, the storyline flows with ease and does not feel dragged or overbearing at any point.All characters do well to support the main lead.

Every scene which was shot was well thought and executed.The new girl who stars opposite our main lead is so sweet that I think she will be our National crush for quite some time. The love story portrayed is so pious and pure that it creates magic. The narration part by hero's friend is also hilarious.

            "Review: \"12th Fail\" revives the memories of realistic cinema ( or parallel cinema as some would call it) of late seventies or early eighties. The story telling and narrative is simple and easy, no unnecessary twists have been applied.Vikrant Massey playes the role of 'Manoj' superbly, he gets into the skin of the hapless character. Great chances of him begging some big award for it this year. 'Shraddha' played by Medha Shankar is OK. She looks good but needs to work on her expressions. Anshuman Pushkarna plays the role of \"Gauri Bhayya\" with aplomb and make it look so real like. The role of Pandey played by Anant Joshi could have been scripted better to provide a comic relief to the otherwise serious film. He is also a narrater (sutradhar) of the story, but seems like the director lost confidence in him midway and his character ended shapeless. Overall an excellent \"must watch\" movie, but then you dont expect anything less than this from a Vidhu Vinod Chopra film.\n",

The boy has happily ever after with the girl.It has some comedic moments. It also has a lot of heart as you would expect from such a film. The scenes between Manoj (Vikrant) and his family are wholesome and emotional.But it fails to evoke that emotion of despair and hopelessness that every aspirant has felt. Vikrant Massey has been shown to be too positive. No human is that positive in those conditions. Thus, audience doesn't really feel the pain of the protagonist and hence the ending success feels like a whimper.Some hardships have been exaggerated which leads to many eye roll moments. No, sleeping only 3 hrs. Every night will not lead to success in any exam.The last interview scene is very badly written. No, there is no roundtable and the interviewer is not there just to cut off your every statement.Overall, I felt it should also have addressed the dark side of the whole civil services rat race. Also, greatly simplifies the issue of corruption with good and bad people.\n",

The idea of the film is all right, but the plot is really predictable and doest not really offer anything that would surprise viewers.It amazes me how this kind of film has a 9,2 rating when there are far better Indian films that also are based on a true story, for example Dangal or Jai Bhim.

You get happy when they get happy and in the end. You feel satisfied & relax that yes.

            "Review: In a cinematic landscape that often prioritizes gloss and glamour, 12th Fail emerges as a refreshing and deeply inspiring narrative. Directed by the ever-versatile Vidhu Vinod Chopra, this film is a compelling exploration of human determination, resilience, and the indomitable spirit that drives individuals to rise above their circumstances. Based on a true story, 12th Fail is not just a movie; it's a movement, a testament to the power of perseverance.The plot centers around the life of Manoj Kumar Sharma, played with remarkable depth and sensitivity by Vikrant Massey. Manoj, a young man from a small town in Madhya Pradesh, dreams of becoming an Indian Administrative Services (IAS) officer. However, the road to success is fraught with challenges, societal pressures, and personal failures. The title, 12th Fail, refers to a pivotal moment in Manoj's life-a moment that would have broken most, but for him, it becomes the turning point that propels him toward greatness.What makes 12th Fail stand out is its raw and unfiltered portrayal of failure. Bollywood is often criticized for sugar-coating reality, but this film does not shy away from depicting the harshness of life. Manoj's journey is riddled with setbacks, from the financial struggles of his family to the personal battles with self-doubt and the constant pressure to conform to societal expectations. Yet, it is precisely these moments of despair that highlight the resilience of the human spirit.Vikrant Massey's performance is the heart and soul of 12th Fail. Known for his nuanced portrayals, Massey once again delivers a performance that is both powerful and poignant. He brings Manoj to life with a quiet intensity, making the audience feel every moment of his anguish, determination, and eventual triumph. Massey's ability to convey complex emotions with subtlety is commendable; his portrayal of Manoj is relatable and deeply human. He is not just playing a character; he embodies the hopes, dreams, and fears of millions who dare to dream despite their circumstances.Vidhu Vinod Chopra's direction is masterful. He navigates the story with a deft hand, ensuring that the narrative remains grounded and relatable. Chopra avoids the trap of melodrama, instead opting for a more realistic portrayal of Manoj's journey. The film's pacing is steady, allowing the story to unfold organically. Chopra's attention to detail is evident in every frame, from the authentic portrayal of a small-town setting to the realistic depiction of the educational system in India.The supporting cast also deserves special mention. Each character, whether it's Manoj's supportive family, his steadfast friends, or the harsh teachers and officials, is well-etched and contributes to the overall narrative. These characters are not just fillers; they are integral to the story, representing different facets of society and the various challenges one faces on the road to success.The film's music, composed by Shantanu Moitra, perfectly complements the narrative. The songs are soulful and poignant, reflecting the emotional highs and lows of Manoj's journey. The background score is subtle yet effective, enhancing the overall mood of the film without overpowering the narrative.12th Fail is more than just a story about one man's journey; it's a reflection of the struggles faced by countless individuals who are often dismissed by society for not fitting into conventional molds of success. The film resonates on multiple levels-it's a commentary on the flawed education system, the societal obsession with marks and ranks, and the immense pressure placed on young minds. But above all, it's a story of hope. It's a reminder that failure is not the end; it's merely a stepping stone on the path to success.The film also makes a strong case for re-evaluating our definitions of success and failure. It challenges the notion that academic excellence is the only measure of worth and instead celebrates the qualities of grit, determination, and perseverance. In a world that often celebrates instant success, 12th Fail is a powerful reminder that true success is earned through hard work, resilience, and an unwavering belief in oneself.In conclusion, 12th Fail is a must-watch. It's a film that will leave you introspective, inspired, and deeply moved. Vikrant Massey's stellar performance, combined with Vidhu Vinod Chopra's expert direction, makes this film a standout in Bollywood's recent offerings. Whether you are a student, a parent, or someone who has faced setbacks in life, 12th Fail will resonate with you on a personal level. It's a celebration of the human spirit, a tribute to those who refuse to give up, and a reminder that failure is not a defeat but a detour on the road to success.\n",

It's really rare in Bollywood nowadays.A movie that inspire millions is indeed rare.People of any age can enjoy this wonderful movie. There is no such nudity or inappropriate content so it's again a plus point for the movie.The fact that it is based on a true life story makes it even more inspiring. The way they made the movie the story telling, everything was perfect. Actually this movie deserves a lot more recognition. This movie is really underrated. The daily struggles of students from villages and people in villages is well shown in this movie. Deserves a lot of awards.!\n",

            "Review: A very cliche movie. A classic rags to riches story that in my opinion brings very little to the table. In certain ways I enjoyed Aspirants more because of the interesting back and forth creating a contrast between past and present. You already know the guy becomes an IAS but how you get there is now that much more intriguing. Here we are told a linear story filled with hardships that while I can admit are truly difficult to surpass don't feel interesting enough to get through. It feels a bit boring knowing what's about to come with every step. The leap of faith theme that they used also felt so lame. The interview scene and I don't know how accurate it is so can't tell but it reminded me of the one in 3 idiots where Sharman Joshi's character starts off on a negative vibe and turns it into something positive. Overall it's an okay movie with nothing too groundbreaking and definitely not deserving of a 9 or 10 rating.\n",

            "Review: Major complain is that this movie has nothing new to offer except endless struggle and steadfast nature of the protagonist. It is the same story about an extremely competitive exam and how every characters life revolves around it.Movie is really average at best and plot is very linear and predictable as well. I guess this is another type of \"mass\" genre that includes a lot of struggle, injustice, poverty and heartbreaks instead of violence, sex and nudity in stereotypical \"mass\" movie.Coming to acting, Vikrant massey was good as usual and anant joshi and anshuman pushkar did a reasonably good job.Was this movie inspirational, to some point yes but the obsessive nature towards one exam and willing to waste 5-6 years of your 20s is something nobody talks about.\n",

Nothing this guy had nothing.That interview was superb, you could see the disdain in the eye of the prime interviewer, and the respect growing in other 3 peoples ' eyes. Every question was like a chess move, testing his reactions and answers. Too good.And then when he got that selection, and when his mother said that you have passed the exam. Watched it multiple times, every time I tear up at that scene.The audio design, screenplay, cinematography and acting. Top notch.\n",

These cinematic gems, often overshadowed by the glitz of celebrity, have an inherent power to resonate deeply. Their impact extends beyond the confines of the screen, serving as wellsprings of inspiration for individuals across diverse sectors. By weaving compelling narratives and tapping into universal themes, these movies forge connections that endure, proving that the magic of storytelling can be independent of the marquee names attached. In their subtlety, they manage to touch the chords of the human experience, fostering a sense of relatability that transcends the glamour of big-budget productions. It is this ability to speak to the universal aspects of the human condition that renders them timeless and capable of leaving an indelible mark on the hearts and minds of audiences.\n",

It was very motivating.It reminding me of all shonen anime lead characters who decide one thing and then give every ounce of their life in achieving that goal.The storyline seems very understated on papers but to my surprise, the movie was very entertaining. 2.5 hours or screentime felt like a breeze. The characters didn't allow us to loose focus.The music was also nice. And thankfully this had a happy ending.\n",

It delves into the heart of India's most grueling exam, the UPSC, through the inspiring journey of Manoj Kumar Sharma, played with remarkable nuance by Vikrant Massey.The film transcends the typical exam preparation narrative. It portrays the struggles and sacrifices not just of the aspirants, but also their families and friends. The supporting cast, particularly Medha Shankar and Anant V. Joshi, delivers powerful performances that resonate deeply.Director Vidhu Vinod Chopra masterfully weaves a tapestry of emotions, from the desperation of failure to the elation of triumph. The cinematography is subtle yet effective, capturing the raw essence of life in both rural and urban India. Shantanu Moitra's music adds another layer of depth, perfectly complementing the narrative.\"12th Fail\" is more than just an ode to perseverance. It's a testament to the power of dreams, the significance of family and friendship, and the unwavering spirit of the human race. It's a film that will stay with you long after the credits roll, leaving you motivated and inspired.\n",

Excellent pacing too, which the director skilfully translates into a visual masterpiece. While the music adds to the story, the real winner is the use of sound effects in the storytelling -- adding to the multi-sensory experience that is cinema. And such fine acting!All these fine technicalities come together to create a masterpiece that will move and inspire you. And this story is told in such a way that a multi-generational family can sit together and watch it with no discomfort, each finding a part of themselves in this wonderfully uplifting tale.\n",

Film could have been made a bit shorter excluding at least 20-30 mins.Overall : A decent one to watch if you have patience for slow burners but not that great as hyped by some people on social media.\n",

This one started with me going - just another one of those, that are selling now a days, but turns out not so. This has true emotions, true situations, true beliefs and truth about what it is to even come close to making it in India.

We need these types of biographical movies to show how people struggle to realize their dreams, how they evolve as human beings, how they find love and how they achieve what they couldn't even have imagined. From the start the movie kept me very engaged and every moment I could feel the pain and agony Manoj was feeing. Pressure of family, new cities, new people, hindi vs English challenges, societal pressure and much more to drag him down. While all actors did great job, Vikrant did fantastic acting along with Shradhha. This move shows nothing is impossible if you put your heart and mind to it. Overall, amazing movie.

            "Review: On a lazy weekend, scrolling through Netflix to find something good is pretty common. But when you stumble upon a movie that really touches your heart, it's special. Today, I watched the Hindi film \"12th Fail,\" and it hit me on a deeper level.In Bollywood, we often see the same old story: a hero and heroine with songs, some jokes, fights, and lots of drama. But \"12th Fail\" is different. It's like watching real life on screen. It takes you on a journey as if you're right there.Spoiler alert: The story starts in a small Indian village with a family of six struggling to get by. They don't have the same opportunities as others, like education or owning a business. The movie shows how people in power keep them down, crushing any chance of them getting ahead.But then comes our hero, who breaks through all the barriers and becomes an IPS officer, one of the highest positions in India. His determination, drive, and honesty help him reach his dream. It's a simple story, but it is so real and relatable. It's a nice change from the usual hero who's all muscles and fights like a superhero.Movies have a big impact, especially in India where everyone loves them. They're part of our lives. I think they should tell more stories like this, showing real people as heroes and inspiring the next generation.This is my first movie review, and I want to give a big shoutout to the whole team behind \"12th Fail,\" especially Vikrant Massey for his amazing performance. And thanks for keeping the movie clean. It's rare to find a gem like this.If you haven't watched \"12th Fail\" yet, I highly recommend it. It's definitely worth your time.\n",

            "Review: Restart!This rallying call has undeniably become my anthem for the days ahead, and quite possibly, weeks to come. For those uninitiated, the inspiration behind this fervent cry lies in \"12th Fail,\" unequivocally the Hindi film of the decade in my estimation, standing shoulder to shoulder with cinematic titans like \"Good Will Hunting\" (GWH) and \"The Shawshank Redemption\" (SR).GWH intricately weaves the tale of a genius, Will Hunting, who conceals his brilliance while resisting attempts to be pigeonholed as 'mainstream' or 'endearing.' Every character, regardless of their size in the narrative, is etched into memory. The poignant lakeside monologues between Matt Damon's Will and Robin Williams' therapist, the cinematic finesse capturing the incendiary act at the MIT office, and the intimate close-ups revealing Will's fear of commitment-all contribute to the enduring charm of the film. The film's exceptional attention to psychological intricacies and the transformative power of human connection earned it stellar reviews and multiple Oscars.In a parallel vein, SR unfolds the gripping story of Andy Dufresne, a banker framed for his wife's murder and sentenced to life. What sets it apart is its emphasis on resilience and the indomitable human spirit. Faced with adversity, Andy imparts timeless wisdom to his fellow inmate Red: 'Get busy living or get busy dying.' Quietly channeling his frustration and anger, Andy engineers a spectacular escape, emphasizing the power of hope and determination. The film's meticulously crafted narrative, poignant storytelling, and an unexpected twist in the tale make it a classic in its own right.In this illustrious league, \"12th Fail\" rightfully claims its spot and foresees multiple Oscars. Vikrant Massey's performance is so compelling that watching it consecutively-first on OTT and then immediately in the nearest theater-left me yearning for more.The meticulous attention to detail in \"12th Fail,\" as seen in scenes like Vikrant's swift meal in Gwalior, with the clock showing 10:10 upon entry and 10:24 upon exit, or the inclusion of a cab in Delhi bearing the Uttarakhand number \"UA...\" after his girlfriend's mention of her father hiring a private cab from Mussoorie to Delhi, elevates the film. The tantalizing dance between light and shadow, as in scenes where Vikrant meets his Dadi after clearing his BA and when walking with his GF around Diwali, with the camera expertly capturing emotions heightened by these effects, is nothing short of surreal. Each character, no matter how fleeting their appearance, leaves an indelible mark.The film's portrayal of the struggle, values, passion, and camaraderie is genuinely awe-inspiring, borrowing the best elements from GWH's psychological depth and SR's emphasis on resilience. \"12th Fail\" imparts a crucial lesson, one equally applicable to the many other realms of life: failure is not an option. Tune out the noise, concentrate, and..Restart!\n",

The main reason behind the hype was only due to it's story about the IPS exam. People in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh root for these exams. Main goal of most of the graduates of these countries is to become a civil servant. So, people liked it a lot.From cinematic point of view, the story could be better. For quite a time the story focused on the protagonist's love story which I don't think wasn't that important.Then comes the acting. While Vikrant Massey was good others were not that good.In a nutshell, it's an enjoyable movie but don't keep a high expectation.\n",

Alone, helpless yet stubborn and self-confident at the same time.Almost all the actors do well, almost everyone's performance has touched the audience. The film will be a milestone in the career of all of them.Vikrant Messi is a familiar face on the web. His performance in Mirzapur was outstanding. I was first impressed by his role in the 'Rise' miniseries. But as an actor, he did not have any milestone in the movie. 12th Fail made up for that lack.The struggle of real IPS officer Manoj Kumar Sharma is really remarkable. His story will inspire many in coming days. Honesty, hard work and dedication always pays off. That's the moral of Manoj's story. Never give up on your dreams.\n",

            "Review: Remarkably written and brilliantly directed. Equally rewarding is to watch the acting prowess exhibited by all to perfectness, particularly Vikrant Massey, simply love seeing this actor work his genius on screen. It was nice to Anant Joshi after Kathal. He is a talent that I would keep an eye out for, in the futurities. Medha Shankar very ably played the quintessential companion that is a rare find under the circumstances and hence, could not have been easy to play. Anshumaan Pushkar's role though was limited, leaves an indelible mark. The film, should be part of a curriculum and must be made tax free across the country, so that it can not only reach every nook and corner of the country, but also the farthest depths of every individual's heart and soul, and create ripples of motivation and hope, and inspire him that no matter what the hardships of life, we shouldn't give up to contribute to the society. Very happy that my year is ending with this beautiful and endearing message of the movie.\n",

            "Review: It has a very good story line. India should focus on making this kind of movies. The audience should also start watching and loving this kind of movies. It's this kind of movies that goes unnotice due to big commercial movies. I believe this kind of movies that gives birth to future movie stars. We as an audience have to start watching and supporting this type of movies.commercial movies will come and go but we need movies that highlights the real situation of indian society. I know commercial movies are necessary for business aspects, but dont let this kind of movies go unnoticed. We have to pay attention to this kind of genre.\n",

            "Review: Tone, Script & Story: The story is about a man from Chambal who fails twelfth but becomes an IPS officer after cracking UPSC in his fourth attempt. The story is warm and bring tears to viewer's eyes in final moments.At first I was on a rigid view that a twelfth fail cannot crack UPSC but then it occurred the movie is inspired from real events. Also why it cannot after all, of lakhs why can't one of them shine in such a way.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: The village, the library, places where main character worked-lived, where they hanged out, coaching, etc all have been captured well.Music is average. Acting is commendable. A real deal of honest performances.Final Verdict: There is hope for everyone. The movie brings joy to all competitive aspirants.\n",

            "Review: Most of the Indian movies one gets to see in his life taste of plastic, fake reality and abound in the fantastic, whilst aiming to still keep the viewer emotionally overengaged. Not this one, surely it makes the normal effort into a journey, and creates an achievement from the norm, but is a much less violation of ones expectations, and somehow can make into the poetical freedom a director can take with its work.It is a well rounded movie, under the Indian class, but that should not demean it in the global market. So I would think it is a new drama on the underdog fight in the intellectual world of reaching to be a Police officer.This may not be a lot for the Western viewer, but it is quite an achievement for the Indian viewer, and story delivers.Negatives - the dialogue comes pre-chewed and stale, character development is expected from the get go, the story generalizes the good and the bad, which it delivers at biblical proportions, with some revenge, backlash and abuse, all requested for the movie to work.\n",

            "Review: Imagine a movie about an underdog cracking the grueling UPSC exam, packed with tips, strategies, and the raw grit of the journey. Sounds inspiring, right? \"12th Fail\" promises that, but instead delivers a Bollywood rom-com in an IPS officer's uniform.The protagonist's 12th-fail shame fades against the spotlight of a predictable love story. Sure, romance adds fluff, but not when it steals the show from the real struggle. Forget YouTube's real-life aspirants sharing their blood, sweat, and tears; \"12th Fail\" serves overdramatized montages and contrived twists like stale popcorn.The interview, meant to be a heart-pounding climax, turns into melodramatic theater compared to the genuine anxieties and triumphs online. Where's the nitty-gritty? The subject selection, the study routines, the mental battles - that's what would have truly sparked a fire.If this was a true story, a window into a real-life underdog's climb, then yes, bring on the preparation details! But instead, we're stuck with cliched Bollywood beats under the guise of originality. Skip the predictable plot and manufactured drama, and seek inspiration where it thrives - in the raw stories of those who truly chased the IPS dream. They'll offer more fire in a single WhatsApp message than \"12th Fail\" does in its entire runtime.So, unless you're craving a sappy love story with an IPS backdrop, save your time. This movie fails to capture the true essence of the UPSC grind, leaving you wanting something, anything, that feels real. Choose authenticity over Bollywood cliches, and you'll find your inspiration elsewhere.\n",

Vv Chopra is good as always. One side there's an Animal - one side 12th fail , It's our responsibility to encourage good movies. Thanks.\n",

What to say about Vikrant Massey! I am his fan since he used to act in the daily soaps. He made the moments alive with his powerful acting skill. He is a natural actor he acts like we take breath haha.. And to tell about the other actors Anshuman Pushkar made a great impact though he is a supporting actor in this cinema. I'm a big fan of him too from the webseries 'Grahan'. The actors who played the characters of Sraddha Joshi and Pandey.. they did justice to their characters too. As we all know the story of the cinema is really inspiring. And the story being a real life incident is more appealing. Everything in this cinema is perfect.. Direction, casting, dialogue delivery everything. A good watch and this is not a one time watch. The vibe of this cinema will stay with you for sometime. It is 31st December today.. a good way to end our year with positive vibe. Thank you to the everyone who is related to this cinema and a big salute to Mr. Manoj Sharma and Sraddha Joshi.\n",

            "Review: When \"12th Fail\" suddenly vaulted into IMDb's Top 250 Films list (at #54 as I write this), I knew it was a movie I wanted to see. It was just picked up by Netflix, making it available for anyone with that streaming platform. I found the story of Manoj Kumar Sharma (Vikrant Massey) to be one of inspiration and perseverance, though the film itself doesn't achieve the cinematic brilliance to merit such a high rating. Most of the reviews here appear to have been posted by fellow countrymen of the director and filmmakers with a definite bias toward elevating the picture beyond its earned level. Based on a true story, what I would say about Manoj is that he should serve as an inspiration for all those poor citizens mired in the same circumstances of poverty by birth, who suddenly find themselves elevated by belief in a higher value predicated on honesty and truth. Instead of accepting a lower caste expectation for his position in life, Manoj found the courage and fortitude to endure years of manual labor while studying at night to fulfill his dream. Undeterred by the corruption he witnessed around him, Manoj's leap of faith at his final interview by answering a question honestly earned him the appreciation of board members that helped sway the interviewer Dr. Mehta (Rahul Dev Shetty) to reconsider his emotional bias. At two and a half hours, the picture is probably longer than it needs to be to make its point, although that's not a complaint. I don't mind longer movies as long as they're engaging, which this one was. The musical accompaniment was well placed and not set apart from the main drama as so many Hindi movies seem to engage in. Overall, the film is worthwhile viewing with a distinct message that bears recommendation to a wider audience.\n",

Acting is good and direction ok ok. Cliche lines and over the top emotional scenes which clearly feels funny sometimes. Vikrant massey has done good job though. The real couple whose story they showed is not at all worthy of such praise, they r just government servants that's it. I couldn't figure out why so much hype on it.All in all another overrated fake story by bollywood. Don't know when they are going to accept truth.\n",

This movie is much more than an Entertainer. It's an emotion of a Common man! Watching this will really motivate a demotivated one, will make one to move who was just about to halt their steps way forward, in short the real characters and this movie's plot is really inspirational and people really need such kind of films as well. As per my ideology movies are also a medium to pass knowledge, information, wisdom, messages etc. Just like a book, blog etc.In one word if I would need to describe the quality of picturisation and the way they have represented the plot, it would be NATURAL!!!\n",

            "Review: Overview :A visual product from India where it deviates away from all the glam and glitter, endless songs and stylised fight scenes, 12th Fail is a masterpiece where inspiration is the keyword here and personally it is one of the best movies I have seen this year (12th Fail was released in 2023).Based on Anurag Pathak's bestselling novel of the same name, 12th Fail depicts the true story of an IPS officer Manoj Kumar Sharma hailing from a small town in Chambal, who fearlessly embraced the idea of restarting his academic journey and reclaiming his destiny at a place where millions of students attempt for the world's toughest competitive exam, UPSC.In brief, this film is about perseverance and remaining honest without compromising one's integrity. Not over dramatic, yet dramatic enough to keep you engaged and involved at all points in time, it engages you, sometimes chokes your emotion and surely inspires.1) Script, Screenplay & Dialogues :12th Fail is a triumph of narrative ingenuity. The script, a finely woven tapestry of emotions and conflicts, engages the audience in a visceral journey that oscillates seamlessly between moments of heart-wrenching vulnerability and soaring triumph.Writer-director Vidhu Vinod Chopra went through 179 draft changes to the script before finally rolling the camera. Chopra used this inspiring and exciting tale as his canvas and paints it with several emotions - of pain, anger, failure, victory, helplessness and confidence, all in a great balance. The film was co-written by Jaskunwar Kohli, with Aayush Saxena credited as associate writer.Despite not being a larger-than-life action packed love story flick where the Indian commercial cinema is particularly fond of, 12th Fail celebrates rooted, public-minded men and women who swear by the Constitution and are brave enough to go the distance in protecting the principles that it enshrines.9.5/102)Direction :Chopra's filmography, including gems like Eklavya, Mission Kashmir, and Khamosh, has always delved into real-life stories, adapting them seamlessly for the cinematic experience. However, 12th Fail stands out not just for its storyline but for its intelligent direction. Under his direction, the film becomes a compelling cinematic journey celebrating the spirit of youth and triumph over adversity.Chopra's direction crafts a realistic and relatable world, inviting the audience to immerse themselves in the story. Certain scenes are bound to evoke tears. These powerful emotional moments add depth and authenticity to the narrative, making it a truly immersive experience.And based on his mastery, each character is meticulously crafted and impeccably portrayed by the talented ensemble cast, becomes a conduit for the film's thematic resonance, contributing to a narrative depth that transcends the traditional boundaries of the genre.10/103) Cinematography :The film's visual aesthetics are nothing short of breathtaking, with each frame meticulously crafted to evoke a wide range of emotions. Rangarajan Ramabadran's cinematography is spellbinding, capturing the essence of the characters' struggles and triumphs in a way that is both visually stunning and emotionally poignant.The use of light and shadow is particularly noteworthy, adding layers of symbolism to the story and enhancing the overall viewing experience. The cinematography succeeds in bringing the characters' struggles and triumphs to life in a visually stunning manner.The only flaw that I could see was the usage of a wide-angle lens capturing a wide of Manoj walking towards the interview room. The pillars naturally become distorted or symmetrically off.9.5/104) Production Design :Production Designer Prashant Bidkar was tasked with bringing the grounded, relatable narrative of 12th Fail to life. He elevates familiar everyday settings with the use of rugged realism. Costume design, helmed by Malvika Bajaj, work in tandem and seamlessly blend aesthetics and harmony with the film's milieu.9/105) Casts :Vikrant Massey's portrayal of Manoj is nothing short of brilliant, breathing life into the narrative with his impeccable acting. The on-screen portrayal of Manoj has become a symbol of the dreams and struggles faced by millions of underprivileged job seekers in India, evoking a profound emotional response from the audience.Massey as Manoj is the beating heart of the film. He brings a rare vulnerability, honesty and earnest dignity to his character. His nuanced performance allows us to empathise with the character's journey, laying the foundation for the transformation from an ignorant teenager to the unwavering determination of a struggling young competitor. His performance goes beyond mere dialogue delivery and cements his status as a standout talent.Medha Shankar makes a confident debut with 12th Fail and her Shraddha shares a rather genuine chemistry with Manoj. Her character is beautifully written with a whole lot of finesse.In his supporting role, Anant V Joshi as Pritam Pandey delivers a nuanced portrayal that captures the dual intention of support and jealousy with finesse. Anshumaan Pushkar, as the mentor Gauri Bhaiya, brings an uplifting presence to 12th Fail.9.5/106) Post Production, Sound Editing, Music :The conventional editing style occasionally disrupts the viewing experience. However, when it breaks away from the pattern and lingers on a shot, it creates cinematic and emotional magic.Shantanu Moitra's background score works in tandem to create an auditory symphony that not only captures the essence of each moment but also elevates the emotional resonance. The music is subtle yet effective, enhancing the film's tone and mood. With only three instruments used, including a sitar, flute, and another unidentified instrument, the music complements the storytelling and adds depth to emotional scenes, such as the protagonist's interview and moments of triumph.The sound design by Manav Shrotriya adeptly captures moments of chaos, nuances, and silences with alacrity, transporting us seamlessly into the universe of the film and heightening our engagement with the characters.9/10What truly makes 12th Fail a cinematic gem is its ability to leave a lasting impact on its audience. The ideas in the film make you think about your own life and get inspired by the characters' stories. It also makes you question what people usually think about success and failure, pushing you to see personal achievements in a new way.In conclusion, 12th Fail is an awesome choice for those people who think they have lost everything in life, especially for students. It's a kind of movie that makes you think deeply about life and overcome the challenges in life.Restart! Restart! Restart!Overall rating : 9.5/10.\n",

            "Review: This film actually made me cry at the end which I didn't expect it would make me do, when he passed his application and got the position he wanted. The 3rd act was handled real well. I got really invested in the main character Manoj and everyone did very good in the movie with their performances. The film was shot and directed really well too and while this isn't typically my kind of movie, I have to acknowledge that it is a significant one. Life is truly a rollercoaster with ups and downs but if you never give up on your dreams and work incredibly hard, you can do anything you want to. I even enjoyed the romance angle of the movie and the chemistry and connection that Manoj and Shraddha had with each other. The only thing that came across as strange to me was how they spoke Hindi with English frequently being sprinkled in randomly. Is that a normal thing? Why did they do that? It seemed strange to me but that's a minor inconsistency. A real emotional film!\n",

Whilst the struggles displayed is realistic, during the screening I had a regret. Those who crack this exam are top brains without any further qualifications but the finished product is anything but. Having worked for 3 different state owned institutions in as many countries this much is clear. So, the Indian system takes the best brains & churns out at best a mediocre output. Yet the craze for this babugiri remains Himalayan.What a waste of a country's talent!Anyways, it was a fun and at times fascinating watch.\n",

            "Review: This movie had a great story which is based on true events. The makers could have driven the story to motivate people in a great way to pursue their dreams for becoming an IAS officer or IPS officer but what they have shown in most of the movie is the romance the main act is involved in, their ups and downs. The director tried to portray the movie more from the romantic side of the protagonist. The music is good, especially the Restart song is very motivational if you want to motivate yourself. Also the daily struggles of the aspirants of the IAS exam could have been shown more vigorously but instead they showed non essential things. Overrated movie doesnt deserve this much high rating!\n",

This is the grit of the rural India, and those who wake up everyday struggling to get out of their pathetic conditions. I hope movies like these get the recognition, awards and box-office collection they truly deserve. All the actors were just perfect in their respective roles. The background score was extraordinary. The cinematography and direction were commendable - raw, beautiful - no makeup, no filters, no typical bollywood heropanti. For once, we are not trying to make poverty look romantic or glamorous. I looked around to find everyone around me crying with joy in the last scene. Knowing that this is a true story, made it even more special. Thank you for this movie!PS - I created an IMDB account today only to write this review, and share my joy with the world. Its that good!\n",

The age old concept of a motivated individual from a village, after a series of lucky breaks, becomes a civil servant.A feel good movie, but not a 9.3 movie for sure. If it addressed things such as why some people are honest and why others were not honest - then it would have been meaningful and maybe great like a 9.3!Glorified presentation of the work of IAS officers which might misguide our current youth who is already wasting so much time trying to get into elite services.\n",

You expect more out of a 2hr movie.The director ( Vidhu Chopra ) didn't do justice with the story. Infact he butchered the story.There were few moments that were capturing, rest were just pushing around. I feel the director decided to make few commercials for the movie that's about it.Rest of the movie he was smoking weed and gave an assistant to direct and why Vidhu Chopra is the writer when this movie is out of a book on real life, by an actual writer, such a same.After all these years, these so called famous directors still take others work and put their name, such a pity.It's a good one time watch. Could have been better if this movie was without this big Bollywood glam or without Mr Chopra.TVF series are not only inspiring but one can watch and enjoy on repeat. I know I should not compare but I was confused was this director was making a love story or inspiring UPSC story.\n",

Yesterday we saw the movie ' 12th Fail' as it was recommended to me by someone whom I admire We really enjoyed the movie it was so inspiring and motivating. (Its bio graphical movie based on real life story) . When hunger for achieving your goal is strong then you do not feel the pain of your struggles. Vikrant Massey has acted really well , screenplay and direction was equally good and very close to real life situation. I am sure this will inspire many UPSC and career oriented boys and girls . At the budget of 20 crores and box office business of 45 crore so far producers may have earned profits of 25 crore but at the same time it may have ignited more than 25 crore minds with a clear message of 'NOT TO GIVE UP' at any cost . Meaningful cinema is a great service to the society. If you get time please do watch this movie its still running at the cinemas its much better than Patahan,Jawans and Tigers🙏🙏\n",

The film offers a simple yet powerful narrative, capturing the essence of the struggles faced by UPSC students across India.What sets \"12th Fail\" apart is its authenticity; there's no unnecessary drama, allowing viewers to connect deeply with the story's realness. The acting, particularly by co-actors like Medha Shankar (Shraddha) and those who portrayed Panday and Gauri Bhaiya, is commendable, adding depth to the narrative.However, it's Vikrant Massey's portrayal of Manoj Sharma that steals the spotlight. His performance is flawless, breathing life into the character and making the journey truly inspiring.Overall, \"12th Fail\" serves as a reminder that no matter the obstacles, with hard work and dedication, one can overcome any challenge. Hats off to the entire team for bringing this inspiring story to life with such sincerity and authenticity.\n",

Absolutely unmissable.Setting and production values are near impeccable with India of 1990s created faithfully. Narrative is smooth and doesn't get bogged down anytime with unnecessary subplots. However it still manages to do justice to the side characters. Acting is first rate by nearly everybody. Characters from village, their diction is so authentic, they won't look like actors at all. Dialogues are written authentically with no foul language (unfortunately that has almost become a fashion these days). And no unnecessary scenes that will make it uncomfortable to watch with family.Above all, it's an uplifting story of a person's incredible triumph despite steep odds, makes you come out from theater with your spirits soaring high. Go watch it, don't miss it for anything.\n",

But looked like lot of cinematic liberties were taken for granted, one thing is people will not be interested in movies without those additions, but movie like this might have avoided it. One example is heros motivation is his family but they showed heroine proposing to him was the top motivation. Also for preparations like civil services one must need enough rest for body and mind, but hero works 15 hrs, 6 hrs of study and only 3hrs of sleep. One more bad thing is trying to hit librarian with shoe, librarian helped to get accomodation and shelter and some money for hero and few before him, but because of a misunderstanding hero tried to hit him with shoe? Also, threatening a police officer by telling him that he will become IPS officer and suspend him shows immaturity.\n",

The 12th FAIL is an absolutely remarkable film, and Vikrant Massey gives an excellent performance as the IPS officer Manoj Kumar Sharma. Vikrant Massey, I am really impressed with your first solo film. I look forward to seeing more of your work with renowned filmmakers. Medha Shankar, who played the role of Shraddha, was absolutely wonderful. Not only did she look stunning, but her performance left an indelible impression on me.

His dialects are perfect. So is her girlfriend played by Medha Shankar, a girl next door, still very strong and a real inspiration. Anand V. Joshi has all the materials for being a Hero's BFF on Hindi Celluloid. Shantanu Moitra is at his best , particularly for background score. You are always amidst the real hub of students of Mukherjee Nagar and the environment has been created by Shantanu.I would have given it a 10 but I have to cut 2 marks for its predictability. We expect some magic from Vidhu and he could have created some more drama to involve the audience more.#DisneyHotStar #anwarsays #upscexam #chambal #cheating #grit #VikrantMassey #VidhuVinodChopra #movie2023 #realstory.\n",

            "Review: Good movie worth a watch. However not deserving of 9+ rating it's getting. First half an hour is good when hero decides to do IPS. Then movie becomes typical underdog achiever movie and fairly predictable. Hero does lots of hardships, gets doses at luck at right time and places, has brief fling with romance, and achieves his dream.Without inspiring songs or emotional montage, such movies leave nothing to latch onto for viewer. Complete absence of songs doesn't help either. There is no aftertaste or lingering feeling. Not to mention, his dream while projected in idealist tone, was purely materialistic with goal of getting high paying government job. What honest stuff did he achieve after becoming IPS is not referenced even in end credits.\n",

            "Review: 7.9/10This is a movie about an IPS officer Manoj Kumar played by Vikrant Massey. His acting skills are commendable in this movie which does increase the movie's quality. The movie shows his struggles in becoming a IPS Officer considering he is from a small village.We do feel emotionally attached with the character of Manoj, as it clearly shows the struggles and the final victory of the character.The movie has a good screenplay and acting by the entire cast, we do feel heart touched during the scenes. The way the directed presented the story is pretty good.No movies are without flaws, and this does have a couple of them.The main issue of the movie is the pacing, certain scenes go on for wayyy to long than it needs to be and its gets tiresome in some point. Considering that it's a real life based movie, they should have included a little bit of drama to interest the audience.A runtime of 2hrs and 28 mins is a little lengthy, and cutting out about 10 minutes would do no harm.The predictability is also a major issue, it was very evident of how he would fail every exam until the very last attempt. A guy who was very focused In his studies, suddenly remembered his family's state and decided to work more and study less, that was so evident.The final thing about stereotypical problem of how rich kids are always shown as everything is given to them in a silver platter. Even if it is, just showing it off so much in a movie more focused on the struggles felt a little ehh.Like instead looking down at the privileged ones to glorify the poor based people, why don't they show both their struggles??This movie is great considering how much trash and mass movies like Jawan - Pathaan is getting famous now, a movie like this is very much needed.\n",

What makes it an amazing watch is everything ; acting , editing , all the casts, .The female supportive lead brings the charm in this important movie . VVC, for me , it's his best movies and maybe one of their best movies for the whole team . The movie is an ode to resilience , patience and hard work,and optimism. This movie is essential one , as an epitome of what a grounded story can be, and example of what a good movie should look like .It's heartwarming movie , such a satisfying watch . The scores are done well, the screenplay and direction are top class . Vikrant Massey makes me so happy to watch, his acting evolving and making himself bigger and better with each one ones .What did not work :\n",

Not only will you enjoy it, but it will also touch you, teach you, and instill a deeper appreciation for the life it portrays.Vikrant Massey has been given a genuine character to portray, and he has executed it beautifully.With Vidhu Vinod Chopra at the director's helm, the film is a masterpiece. The meticulous work, the placement of characters, and bringing it all to life on screen make it undoubtedly one of the best offerings from Hindi cinema in 2023.It is a must-watch, without a doubt.

            "Review: \"12th Fail\" is a cinematic masterpiece that left me profoundly inspired and motivated. The film, witnessed in a full-packed theatre, delivered an emotional and reflective experience that will linger in my heart for years to come.Vikrant Massey's portrayal of Manoj Kumar Sharma is nothing short of exceptional. His dedication to the role brings an authenticity that resonates deeply, earning my heartfelt applause. Massey's performance is a testament to his talent and commitment to storytelling.Director Vidhu Vinod Chopra deserves accolades for steering this poignant narrative. His ability to capture the essence of the struggles faced by UPSC students and present it with sincerity and depth is commendable. Chopra's directorial finesse adds an extra layer of emotional richness to an already compelling storyline.Chopra's previous collaborations with Rajkumar Hirani, such as \"3 Idiots\" and \"Munna Bhai MBBS,\" have been personal favorites of mine. This film further cements his reputation as a storyteller with a keen understanding of the human experience.\"12th Fail\" not only tugs at the heartstrings but also prompts deep introspection. It's a film that goes beyond the screen, making me reflect upon my own journey. The emotional resonance combined with powerful performances elevates it to a special place in my cinematic memories.I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to watch it again on an OTT platform, this time with my mom and brother. I am excited to share with them the greatness of this movie, hoping it will resonate with them as it did with me.In summary, \"12th Fail\" is a must-watch for its compelling narrative, outstanding performances, and the lasting impact it leaves on the viewer. I wholeheartedly rate it 9/10, making it a standout gem in the world of cinema.\n",

            "Review: Honesty and sincerity of the protagonist, and the struggles and the hardships he endures, and how he continues to stay honest in his journey is inspirational.This is inspired by real incidents. That tag line lends a lot of credence to the movie experience. You feel that someone really did that, and your emotion kicks in against that premise, and thus gains even more strength.The male protagonist has done exemplerary acting. So endearing and charming, you almost wish to have him break the TV and join you for a cup of tea and some chitchat. Camera work, lighting, set design. Everything has been brilliant. The place really feels alive, an immersive experience.Supporting actors have all done excellent work. The female protagonist deserves special mention for a very natural and beautiful portrayal. Romance track has been very nicely captured with some amazing poetry, and many small small nuanced incidents.It is a story of tenacity, and resilience, and purity. A beautiful tale of a young man who stays true to himself in the face of very many challenges. It is exciting and inspiring to see how his path gets forged for him, despite the odds. A must watch!\n",

He had a purpose.We must have a purpose in this life.Sometimes a woman comes into your life and changes it.No matter what, Shraddha is here, Manoj did not leave her alone, even on her bad day, he helped her no matter what she needed.When it comes to friendship, sometimes our friends may make mistakes, we should forgive them because there can be no resentment or ill will in friendship.This movie is a good movie, but there were some parts I didn't like. It's a predictable movie.It's not a new and different story. So my score is 9.However, I gave it 7 because the other movies were better than this one.I gave it 1 point because it was based on a true story, otherwise I would have given it 6 points.Do you watch movies? It can be watched, but let me tell you in advance, it is a long movie, you may get bored, but you may not be able to watch a good movie.I wish the viewers a good time.\n",

            "Review: \"12th Fail\" appears to be a cinematic endeavor lost in the labyrinth of ambiguity. The film, unfortunately, lives up to its title, lacking a coherent plot that could elevate it beyond the ordinary. The narrative stumbles along without a clear direction, leaving the audience bewildered and searching for a purpose.The characters in \"12th Fail\" are akin to lost souls in a sea of uncertainty, as their arcs remain underdeveloped and fail to mature throughout the storyline. This lack of character depth contributes to the overall feeling of detachment, preventing viewers from establishing a meaningful connection with the protagonists.The intended message of the movie remains elusive, buried beneath a fog of narrative confusion. It's challenging to decipher the core theme or takeaway, leaving audiences questioning the purpose of the film's existence. The ambiguity surrounding the central message robs the movie of any potential impact or resonance.Regrettably, \"12th Fail\" doesn't provide the entertainment value one would hope for. Scenes lack the necessary engagement to captivate the audience, resulting in a lackluster viewing experience. The absence of a compelling narrative and well-defined characters makes it difficult for viewers to invest emotionally in the film.In the end, \"12th Fail\" finds itself lost in the shadows of ambiguity, struggling to deliver a cohesive cinematic experience. The lack of a clear plot, underdeveloped characters, and a muddled message contribute to an overall sense of bewilderment, leaving audiences yearning for a more focused and engaging narrative.\n",

Its heartening to see a movie based on a real person, in truth, a biopic, draw you in with such intensity. Not many movies engage the lachrymal glands as this movie.The supporting characters performance just demonstrates how if we were actually lucky enough to promote real actors rather than the NEPO kids, we could feel rewarded watching these movies.

            "Review: The rise of an underdog from his humble beginning to the pinnacle of his ambition makes for good cinema and if it happens to be a true story, then all the better. The dogged pursuit of desire overcoming obstacles, difficulties and adverses has always captured the imagination of writers, directors and actors from years. This is one such story of perseverance, grit and determination. The protagonist is an extremely poor teenager, the son of a poor farmer in rural Bihar who has dreams of making it big as a government officer. The antagonist is cruel and merciless fate/ destiny which places seemingly insurmountable hurdles in his path.The movie has outstanding direction by Vidhu Vinod Chopra and superb acting by Vikrant Massey. Both deserve all the awards they get and no surprises if they get the National award too. All other aspects of the movie including screenplay, dialogue, cinematography, editing, costume, makeup are top class giving the movie an all round excellence rarely seen in Hindi movies. The scenes of the dusty village, cramped coaching class rooms, the tea shop, the cramming students are all real and rooted to the ground. Not once does anything appear forced or artificial. Vikrant Massey has probably set a benchmark in acting masterclass. The dress he wears, his disheveled appearance, his hesitation to express himself, his shyness, his frustration and agony, his breaking down and his acceptance of reality are all high quality acting and could form a coaching class ( pun intended) for budding actors and for those who call themselves actors.The message of the movie is clear. Keep pursuing your ambition regardless of failures, start again ( restart) when you fail and never give up.\n",

Needless to say, it is a terrific film aided by terrific performances by everyone. The writing strikes the emotional chord exceptionally that during the last 15mins, I found it hard to control the damn tears.This is such an inspiring story and kudos to Vidhu Vinod Chopra for shelling out a gem, by keeping the characters as real as possible.

More than the screenplay progression and shot choices, it's the characters (and their textured performances) that add gravitas to the proceedings. The entire cast (and that includes a pretty long list of supporting acts, mind you) is worthy of a standing ovation. Medha Shankar and Massey make for a lovely pair that goes through several ups and downs.

Till end they tried to made result unpredictable and I was actually worried for the protagonist.Who wants the protagonist to lose after so much disappointments. But it's a very good watch overall, and I am forced to review this because it's a very good movie.Positives ++ ::-\n",
            "BGM is top notch. Storytelling is top notch. All characters are well written, and how a small good deed of yours can change the whole thought process of other person. This promotes us to do good things for others. Most people in the movie were supportive actually. Starting from the DSP, the Dhaba wala giving food for free and not even caring afterwards, Pritam and Gauri bhaiya being always there for him. Well I can't say what to do with all this positive energy. Non toxic relationship with the girl is another good thing to be noted.Obviously a movie can never be perfect in all sense, and this one may lack in being slightly unrealistic( as they say ) or predictable nature( which I liked too), but it's definitely a 10. And we should support this kind of movies in bollywood.I feel bad that I watched it on hotstar and not in the theatres because one's near me were busy screening the likes of tiger 3.\n",

            "Review: I just finished watching this movie on hotstar and I feel refreshed.I am not going to mention the story or plot as it is very simple and you will find it anywhere. The journey of this man is beautifully crafted and all the characters in the movie are strong, cooked slowly so that we are with them throughout. One example, Pandey's dad was never shown in the movie and he is seen talking to him over phone, even though you couldn't hear his dad's voice you will know what kind of person he might be. This is the level of attention to detail. All the characters makes you burst into tears and bring smile too - Vikrant, his mom, Shraddha, Gauri Bhaiya, DSP sir oh the list is long.I read somewhere people were saying why Vidhu Vinod Chopra has not signed stars like other movie makers. I think real movie buffs will know the answer. I feel bad that other movies so called big budget ones which are actually hollow becomes blockbusters and collects 100s of crores.Movies like these are keeping the Bollywood cinema alive!Personally I would rate this somewhere around 7.5 to 8 but compared to all the movies around it, it's way more than a 10.\n",

Its purity, unfiltered narrative, unbiased perspective, raw authenticity and well written story along with stellar acting performance is such a joy to watch.It successfully delivered a very important message that hard work and skill are two basic things to achieve the things you want and yet its not just a motivational movie with a huge speach at the end but much more than that as it has great writing, outstanding acting,songs, humour, cinematography etc.This must reach the audience by any means necessary. Let its brilliance shine amidst the blockbuster noise.\n",

Because it has everything i wanted to see, the quotes, the inspirations, the motivation and ofc the #restart. Him restarting everytime he failed was really inspiring to watch. Also shoutout to the cast, Vikrant played manoj perfectly his acting was top-notch. Medhas character as sharaddha was amazing, the way she supported him throughout the movie and her letter at the end she gave it to him before the interview has alot of detail to it. Also the most underrated character was. Anshumaan as Gauri bhaiya, the way he gave it all for manoj to help him study and doesnt get distracted at all shows his dedications towards his students💯, Overall, really inspiring movie.\n",

Must must watch can outclass any movie of this year.Whole family can enjoy and learn and it make you cry and laugh with joy. Do support this movie and it's crew member for their performance. It's a must watch with the kids. This movie definitely represents how poor families in India are surviving and still trying best of their abilities to stay strong.Some work regarding their initial relationship could have been explained better and could have added bit more story of his real life struggling, which I think they missed in the movie.Great work and a great movie, please watch it.\n",

Vikrant Massey and Medha Shnkr were both very nice and their acting seemed so natural and lovely. I saw it again in OTT few days back and had the same feeling as to watching it in the theatre. This movie is a perfect blend of motivation, love, friendship and struggle. And Knowing that it is based on a real story, blows my mind.

            "This one finally made me come here and write about it.This is one of those rare movies that made even a guy who has never shed a tear in any adverse situation in his whole life jerk a tear in the end. Why? Its purity, its celebration of passion and perseverance. The pride of Manoj in his humility in every adverse condition. His passion for the purpose and his perseverance to achieve it.The hurdles he faced and how he faced them... with a smile on his face. That purity of a human being... portrayed on celluloid with conviction.I jerked tears of I don't know what? The joy of victory? The payoff for his perseverance? I don't know. I was just mesmerised by the guy, by the selfless support he received, by the end of helplessness for his family, for him... It was like a turtle with a broken leg on a slippery and huddled hill, racing against a swarm of rabbits with mountain climbing gears. It was emotional. It was empowering. It was inspiring. It was what we call a ray of hope for everyone who feels their leg is cramped in the race of life. You watch this guy's efforts, get inspired, and RESTART...Special mention to Vidhu Sir, hats off to you. Thank you for making this movie.To Gauribhaiya - I'll try to be Gauribhaiya to any Manoj Sharma I come across in my life.P. S. This is a must-watch when you feel you are losing in your life... It'll show you the path of perseverance. Victory is not guaranteed, neither the defeat. So keep calm and RESTART...\n",

Amazing ... such movies should be celebrated and cherished.Unlike those brainless 'Bhai'Saab type movies which has no story .. just riding on old stale and almost dead stardom.It feels good to know there are few honest officers in our country who are trying their best to make common man's life better with their work and actions. I hope this movie inspires our next generation not for upsc but how to lead life in general and how to be a go getter.\n",

An excellent journey of emotions , of dedications , determinations , hardships , struggles , love , companionships , faiths and successes . At some point of watching the movie , mainly during the ending , I was thinking whether the director would give a tragic end to the story by killing the protagonist mid of the way to his home by the Naxalites. I am not not sure whether or not would it have added some political flavour to it or doing so would have ruined the whole of the movie !

Perfect relationship between Manoj and Shraddha. Not just Pritam, literally everybody contributed to his success - starting with his dadi, then Pritam, Gauri sir, librarian, Shraddha, Deep Mohan and last but not the least, his family. Nobody's contribution can be underestimated! 15 hours of work + 6 hours of study + just 3 hours of sleep!! Man, that is just insane!! Coming to his relationship with Shraddha, it is only in these kinds of films where the most beautiful relationships show up.

            "Review: The story of mohan Kumar Sharma is very inspiring indeed, everyone liking the movie and it has become the talk of the town. I would say don't get confused , the story is great , actually it's not a story but based on true events , that the very same reason the movie became popular. When you look at the movie it's just an ordinary movie and it's like a typical vidu vinod Chopra movie , all his movies are in the same pattern and nothing new in this also. Very high emotional drama scenes all through out and added a lot of drama into this comparing the real life events .. actors performance was good and movie is watchable thats all.\n",

A thought came in my mind is it worth but when I watched the movie it was more than worth.Sadly, whole cinema hall was empty because its not a movie of well known actor. People blindly follow their fav big stars.This movie had the real story, to the point acting of each character, no overacting. It is absolutely \"A must watch movie\". Based on the real and true story. VikrantMassey has justified the role so well. Inspirational & motivational movie, no extra cheesy lines, no unrelated songs and romance (intimacy). Everything was best about this movie.Loved it!\n",

            "Review: Numerous individuals labor intensively, often more so than the celebrated hero. Yet, their tales remain untold. The victor, despite enduring fewer hardships, is lauded, his struggles magnified due to his victory. This doesn't imply that success is always the result of hard work or that failure equates to laziness. If we could quantify effort, we'd be privy to a different narrative; one that highlights the unseen endeavors that unfortunately fade into obscurity.Consider the supporting characters who stood by the protagonist. Some risked everything for our hero's cause. Aren't they the real heroes? Any one of them could have been the lead character. Instead, it's the narrator, who despite their loss, is left with the duty of recounting the triumphant tale of our victorious hero.\n",

            "Review: After so much hype about 12th Fail movie, I went to watch it on a Saturday afternoon and yes, its all worth the hype! It's a gem of a movie that shows the lesser-known story of an IPS Officer Manoj Kumar Sharma who belonged to a small village in Chambal, UP. Of the many people who attempt for UPSC, only a handful get selected, and the movie subtly captures short stories of a few people who attempt UPSC. Of course, the main story is about the protagonist - Manoj.The movie has emotional moments of relatability for every aspirant who is in pursuit of their goal. It shows what inspired Manoj and how he kept going even when the tides were against him. You will see the worst-case scenario that you can imagine that happened with Manoj. But it shows how grit, persistence, and support from a few people around you can just bring a world of difference. It's that kind of a movie that society needs and more importantly, the young people need to see.There are a series of lessons that you will be able to draw out of this. When you see Manoj meeting an IPS officer from his village, his view of the world changes - both inwards and outwards. This brings me to my first lesson, which is, if you want to change the world, bring a world of change within you. Secondly, while you see many people have UPSC as their goal, which is fine, but the broader perspective that needs their attention is what will UPSC help them achieve. For Manoj, UPSC was one of the mediums to achieve a broader goal of uplifting underprivileged sections of the society. So, seek long term clarity of your goals. Third, when you see an under-resourced person like Manoj, making the best of everything he has, you will get inspired to stop complaining and make the best out of what you have.Overall, the movie is a must-watch and I will highly recommend to people who are in pursuit of their own goals. Theoretically, there will always be a risk of not achieving it, and if you don't, remember this powerful line from the movie - 'If I cannot be the sun that shines upon the earth, I can still be the lamp that lights up the street'\n",

            "Review: Vikrant Massey delivers a tour-de-force performance as Manoj, a man battling societal expectations and his own doubts to pursue his lifelong dream of becoming an IAS officer. \"12th Fail\" isn't just a film about overcoming academic failure; it's a deeply emotional journey that explores the human spirit's resilience against crushing societal pressures.Massey masterfully portrays Manoj's vulnerability as he juggles family commitments, financial constraints, and the constant burden of proving himself. The film doesn't shy away from the emotional toll of repeated failures, making Manoj's eventual success all the more gratifying.But \"12th Fail\" is more than just a one-man show. The cinematography is stunning, capturing the raw beauty of rural India alongside the bustling chaos of Delhi. The music swells with Manoj's emotions, while the script offers moments of sharp humor amidst the heavier themes.For me, \"12th Fail\" easily earns its place as the best film I've seen in 2023. It's a powerful, relatable story that celebrates the indomitable human spirit and the transformative power of education. It's a film that stays with you long after the credits roll, reminding you that success can bloom even in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds.\n",

I evaluate any movie using it's core elements and this was a win-win in every part.> Cinematography (obviously): The initial surprise and meticulous attention to details, including shots, lighting, environment, and color grading, set a high standard for visual storytelling. (Not exceptional for many but hey that's understandable)> BGM: The well-crafted beats and electronic elements in the first half, complemented by creative and heartwarming female vocals, contribute significantly to the film's overall masterpiece quality.> Story: Despite predictability, the phenomenal portrayal of the narrative avoids any unnecessary \"SYMPATHETIC\" vibes, leaning towards an inspirational tone. While some character arcs may feel rushed, the main ones are thoughtfully developed.> Message: The clear message of resilience and reinvention, exemplified by a 12th fail changing his life through persistent restarts, resonates strongly.Well I'm not into motivation and giving unnecessary lectures on poverty or else. If you're honest, if you're doing hard work, if you're taking things seriously, if you're doing what you love, nothing can stop you from reaching your destination. This is how I took this movie.And the ending is pure gem, it showcased how we Indians (specifying only for this situation) take and appreciate success after a hell of a hard work, our parents, our friends, all those who stood for us, our group celebrations, all of that comes to life. And the joy is real.There's nothing wrong in choosing 'Animal', but missing this piece of art is illegal. Peace. ✌🏻\n",

            "Review: I hate to be the spoilsport. But honestly, I felt the storytelling of \"12th Fail\" was somehow really weak. Don't get me wrong. I can't even imagine how tough it must have been for IPS Manoj Kumar Sharma to crack UPSC from such an unimaginable background. Kudos to him. Not touching that.But if we consider the aspect of storytelling for the movie, that is below par. The majority of the movie focuses on portraying his financial challenges whereas the transition from a \"12th Fail\" to a UPSC interview call-getter was simply not there. At least the interview part could have been a lot less filmy.If movies like Jawan or Animal can run beyond 150 minutes, 12th Fail could have been a little ellaborative, at least for the interview part. IMO, Super 30, Aspirants, Kota Factory, and many more have better storytelling than this.P. S.: If you have a contrary opinion, I respect that. I'm neither a film critic nor a UPSC aspirant myself. But I think I have watched enough movies to have an OPINION. It is nothing but one such opinion.\n",

It's the reason people still love watching movies!Let me explain: I happened to watch this movie just with the intention to escape the scorching heat of Mumbai, a couple of hours in the air conditioned cinema hall was what I was looking for having not heard much about this movie my expectations were close to nil, I even told my sister to wake me up when the movie finishes. But oh boy were we in for a surprise!! The movie took me on a roller-coaster ride, filled with raw emotions and I truly felt part of Manoj's journey. Cheering when things went his way and in tears when things seemed low. I can't believe what I just watched and I can't explain in words how good this movie actually is!I short, this is much better than most of the mainstream movies with stellar starcast! I'd even go as far as saying this should be India's entry to the next Oscars! This is a must watch for anyone who loves cinema! We must appreciate excellence like this so that movies like these continue being made. I don't usually write movie reviews, so this one is probably all around the place, but I just had to come here and appreciate this movie and let the world know, go watch this movie! Take your friends, family neighbors along with you!And a big thanks to the cast and crew of this amazing movie who have restored my faith in Indian Cinema!\n",

No matter the failures we face in life and the conditions we live under, the ones who don't quit are the ones who make it.(If it doesn't work in one field, it will definitely in the other.)\n",
            "(2) Living an honest life irrespective of the field you work in, can get hard sometimes in today's world full of many(if not all) corrupt people at the top but the ones who don't give in to the rigged system and stand by the ethics they believe in, are the real ones and they need more appreciation and recognition from us.If you made it this far, I thank you for your patience and wish you all the best for your future endeavours.\n",

The movie highlights the struggles and challenges faced in India's educational and societal systems, but the execution leaves much to be desired.The pacing is slow, the storytelling feels disjointed, and overall it lacks the kind of engagement that keeps you invested. I only made it about 20 minutes in before deciding to turn it off, as it just wasn't holding my attention.The film could have offered an interesting perspective on India's society, but the dull approach and lack of engaging storytelling made it too difficult to sit through. It's a movie that might appeal more to those familiar with the cultural context, but as an outsider, I found it uninteresting and slow.\n",

            "Review: When the whole world is against you, only your conviction can take you forward. This journey that Vidhoo Vinod Chopra takes us on is an absolute rags to success story based on a true story. While Vikrant massey is a household name who just shines through the entire movie with his innocent smile and vibrant hopeful eyes (as expected), each and every other actor is about to get very famous for their mind-blowing performance. Tears of happiness and sorrow will flow through your eyes, o keep some tissues handy. If you are the emotional type, cozy up to the one you love and hold hands. If you are Stoic and dead inside, get ready to have those hard parts chiseled and melt you in ways you would never understand . Hats off to the Real and reel characters...Thank you all for clearing my Sinuses 🙏\n",

As I'm watching with subtitles, the nuances of the acting can sometimes get lost. But he conveys every emotion with his eyes as much as with his words.Yes, there are one or two dramatic tropes that feel a little 'constructed' but as this is based on a true story, I imagine it isn't far from the real events (despite the careful disclaimer at the outset).The spoilers bit:\n",
            "the story centres on a young man who makes his way from a tough village life in a corrupt region of India, moving to Delhi to study to join the IPC (Indian police). It follows him and his friends, and love interest, as he struggles through the tough exam and interview processes to qualify (apparently only a c.1-2% success rate) without the financial advantages of many of his fellow students. There are genuinely uplifting and rousing moments, particularly in his interview near the end.I will certainly watch this film more than once. Probably gone into my top 10.....\n",

It masterfully excels in every department from all aspect; writing, making, staging, telling, acting, casting, music everything leave you spellbound on every emotional level. VVC's discerning eye discovered the essence of Apu's soul and spirit in Manoj, creating a cinematic masterpiece reminiscent of Ray's films. It's timeless and will be relevant in time. The best Hindi movie of 2023 from the best director and the best actor of that year.\n",

            "Review: \"12th Fail\" isn't a movie, it's an experience. It's the kind of cinematic tapestry that weaves its way into your heart, unraveling threads of empathy, resilience, and the unyielding human spirit. Released in October 2023, this Hindi film is more than just a biopic of IPS officer Manoj Kumar Sharma; it's a poignant reflection on societal pressures, the weight of dreams, and the power of defying expectations.Vikrant Massey embodies Manoj with a quiet intensity, breathing life into his journey from failing the 12th standard exams to becoming a beacon of hope. His eyes, filled with a mix of doubt and determination, mirror the anxieties and aspirations of every student grappling with academic pressures. But \"12th Fail\" isn't just about academic success; it delves deeper, exploring the societal stigma attached to failure, the crushing weight of parental expectations, and the internal conflict of carving one's own path.Director Vidhu Vinod Chopra paints a vivid picture of small-town India, where dusty streets thrum with the collective anxiety of exam season. The constant drone of ticking clocks and the nervous chatter of students waiting for results are not mere props; they're visceral reminders of the pressure cooker environment that defines Indian academic life. Chopra masterfully avoids melodramatic clichés, opting for a raw, almost documentary-like realism that amplifies the film's emotional impact.The supporting cast complements Vikrant's performance flawlessly. Sarita Joshi as Manoj's grandmother is a powerhouse of unwavering faith, anchoring the film with her quiet strength and gentle wisdom. Anshuman Pushkar as Manoj's friend and confidante adds a touch of humor and camaraderie, highlighting the importance of support systems in navigating life's challenges.But \"12th Fail\" thrives on its subtle nuances. The camera lingers on a mother's trembling hand as she signs her son's failed report card, the unspoken disappointment clouding her eyes. It captures the silent rebellion of a young man choosing a different path, the flicker of determination in his eyes as he cracks open a book once again. These are the moments that resonate, that stay with you long after the credits roll.The film isn't without its blemishes. The pacing can feel uneven at times, and some subplots feel slightly underdeveloped. However, these are minor quibbles in the face of the film's overall impact. \"12th Fail\" is a cinematic gem, a story that transcends cultural barriers and reminds us that failure is not a dead end, but a bend in the road. It's a testament to the human spirit's ability to rise above adversity, to redefine success, and to find one's own unique path to fulfillment.This is not a film for critics to dissect, but for hearts to feel. It's a reminder that life is not a single exam, that success comes in diverse forms, and that sometimes, the greatest victories are fought and won within ourselves. It's a movie that inspires you to pick yourself up when you fall, to dust yourself off and rewrite your story, to embrace your \"12th Fail\" as a stepping stone to your own extraordinary future. In a world obsessed with instant gratification and superficial achievements, \"12th Fail\" is a breath of fresh air, a poignant ode to resilience, and a compass that points us towards the true north of compassion, empathy, and the undying human spirit.So, if you're looking for a cinematic experience that will touch your soul, make you laugh, and leave you with a renewed sense of hope, watch \"12th Fail.\" It's more than just a movie; it's a reminder that failure is not the end, it's just the beginning of a different, often more beautiful, journey.\n",

And he defintely would have loved this movie.One of the topics touced by the movie is language and i must admit, i can no longer write or even think in Hindi (i am from hindi medium till 12th). So, should i learn hindi again?I am feeling blessed to have such a story teller like him present. Looking forward to more such movies.\n",

To some, it is not choice to achieve a goal, it is a necessity and this movie depicts the struggle to fulfill their necessity.The characters that are supporting the main character have their own inspiring story as well and are not foreshadowed. How family hides grief to not let son and father derail from the battles they are fighting to achieve their goal is the level of sacrifice some people go to support their loved ones.Always be grateful to people who supported in your journey and always be true to yourself.

It doesn't manipulate the audience by trying to milk the moist from your face, but rather honestly presents scenes in the most artistic and raw way possible. Loved every single minute of this film that I saw it thrice. Brilliant is an understatement. Such films have to be celebrated more.

            "Review: Just completed watching the film \"12th Fail,\" and the overwhelming sentiment persistently echoing in my mind is, \"Wow, what a movie!\" It truly stands as a masterpiece, rendering me utterly speechless. Attempting to articulate the essence of this narrative proves challenging as words falter in capturing its profound impact. This film fulfills the long-awaited desire of the Indian audience to witness a story depicting unwavering dedication towards a lofty ambition, showcasing resilience against social challenges and diverse obligations.The central character, Manoj Sharma, inspired by the real-life IPS officer of the same name and portrayed brilliantly by Vikrant Massey, embodies an indomitable resolve. Even in the face of potential failure in the final attempt at the UPSC exam, depicted in the story's climactic moments, he adamantly refuses to surrender. His motivation extends beyond the ambition of becoming an IPS officer; it reflects a commitment to a higher cause, guiding him to abstain from resorting to dishonesty throughout his life-a truly commendable feat.Director Vidhu Vinod Chopra's sincere approach in presenting the film in its raw style, devoid of flashy dance numbers or songs, exemplifies true cinematic craftsmanship. \"12th Fail\" not only delves into Manoj Sharma's journey but also highlights the individuals who consistently encourage, motivate, and inspire him during his arduous struggle to pass the exam. From his grandmother sacrificing her pension to support his education in an unknown town to his father instilling values of integrity and opposition to corruption, the film portrays a network of unwavering support.DSP Dushyant, a pivotal figure in Manoj's life, imparts crucial lessons on the responsibilities of those in power, shaping his character significantly. The emotional confrontation towards the movie's conclusion brought tears to my eyes. Manoj's circle of friends serves as a constant source of encouragement, celebrating his successes with genuine joy. His girlfriend, Shraddha, becomes an anchor in his pursuit, while Gauri Bhaiya emerges as the guiding light, displaying resilience that fuels Manoj's passion to mentor aspiring individuals facing uncertainty.In my view, everyone should aspire to have a mentor like Gauri Bhaiya-someone who never ceases to believe in you, encouraging a restart even after setbacks. \"12th Fail\" is a poignant portrayal of determination, familial support, and the transformative influence of mentors in the pursuit of one's dreams.\n",

There can be huge difference. A better place is near than ever. There is no need to do bad things. Just good things with a positive attitude.If people think in this way there is no need to show rubbish things to mass population on big screens. Not for entertainment but for a positive and constructive change.If people know the difference between good and bad through actual education, there is no need to show such rubbish dramas over big screens.Such a great movie.\n",

Every student, person struggling and in need of an inspiration should watch this movie. As an average student and today working as a government cadre, I identify part of Manoj's struggle. Never give up no matter how many times you fail or fall. I still can't believe Bollywood made this movie, the director and cast have revived indian cinema. THANK YOU if you are reading this review!

A pure masterpiece from Bollywood.First time a movie made me cry.Embracing the Uncharted Path: A Reflection on the Journey Beyond 12th Grade FailureIn a world often obsessed with grades and academic achievements, the story of a 12th-grade failure unfolds as a poignant narrative of resilience, growth, and the courage to navigate uncharted waters. It is a tale that challenges the conventional definition of success and underscores the profound lessons hidden in setbacks.At first glance, the transcript might tell a story of academic struggle, but behind those grades lies a narrative far richer and more complex. Life has a way of throwing unexpected challenges, and for this individual, the 12th-grade failure became a transformative turning point rather than a roadblock. The journey beyond the disappointment reveals a spirit that refuses to be defined by a single chapter of academic adversity.The true essence of this story lies in the unwavering resilience displayed by the individual. In the face of societal expectations and personal disappointment, they stood tall, refusing to let a momentary setback dictate the course of their life. It is a reminder that success is not a linear path; it is a series of peaks and valleys, each contributing to the overall landscape of personal growth.One cannot help but be inspired by the courage exhibited during this challenging time. Instead of succumbing to despair, the individual chose to view failure not as an endpoint but as a catalyst for self-discovery. This perspective, while unconventional, sets the stage for a unique and remarkable journey that transcends the boundaries of traditional success.Beyond the confines of academic metrics, the story unfolds into a narrative of determination. The 12th-grade failure becomes a canvas on which the individual paints a portrait of tenacity and perseverance. It is a reminder that true success is often born out of adversity, and the lessons learned in the face of failure are invaluable stepping stones towards personal and professional development.As the narrative unfolds, it becomes evident that the individual is not defined by the grades on a piece of paper. Instead, they become the protagonist of a story that encapsulates the human experience-the highs, the lows, and the transformative moments that shape character. This is a tale of embracing vulnerability and finding strength in the face of adversity.The journey post-12th grade failure is not about evading challenges but about confronting them with a newfound sense of purpose. It is a story of self-discovery, where the individual delves into their passions, interests, and strengths that go beyond the confines of a traditional education system. The failure becomes a catalyst for exploring unconventional paths and carving out a niche where personal fulfillment aligns with professional aspirations.In a world fixated on success measured by grades, this story challenges the status quo and offers a narrative that celebrates the resilience of the human spirit. It prompts reflection on the societal pressures that often overshadow the diverse avenues through which individuals can contribute meaningfully to the world.As we navigate through the 600-word journey of this 12th-grade failure, it becomes clear that the true essence lies not in the academic stumbles but in the triumphant rise beyond them. It is a story of metamorphosis, where setbacks pave the way for growth, and the individual emerges stronger, wiser, and more attuned to the intricacies of their own journey.In conclusion, the tale of the 12th-grade failure unfolds as a masterpiece of personal resilience, courage, and self-discovery. It challenges preconceived notions of success and invites us to embrace the beauty of an uncharted path-a path where failures are not obstacles but opportunities for growth, and where success is a multifaceted gem, reflecting the unique brilliance of each individual's journey.\n",

Vikrant Massey portrayed Manoj Kumar Sharma's character exceptionally well. Other actors also did a fantastic job, whether it's Shradha's role, Pandey's, or the characters of Manoj's parents and brother; everyone won hearts. Inspirational films like these should be made more in India. Cinema lovers should watch such movies in theaters instead of on OTT platforms to encourage filmmakers to create more such impactful films.I must say, this film is the best of 2023.

I followed Vikrant Massey on instagram straight away. Even after I found out about the controversies he got caught up with, I still believe in his disposition in life. He is not perfect, no one is. But as an actor, his dedication to inspire those who are struggling and going through hardships in life is legendary.\n",

            "Review: I would like to thank Vidhu Vinod Chopra for telling an inspirational story based on true events, in today's Bollywood where everyone is just try to earn by lazy works and same old formula of masala film, He stood out and made a film on story that needed to be told. We need more films like 12th fail in Hindi cinema or Indian cinema for that matter.The performance of Vikrant Massey was really good. He lived the character of Manoj Sharma. Shradha's character was so beautiful, well done Medha Shankar. We need to appreciate Gauri bhaiya and Pandey ji also.Hope we will se more of VVC and all the actors great performance in near future too. All the best to whole team.\n",

Simply masterpiece , love the way it engage with audience .However, despite the movie's brilliance, I can't help but regret watching it in theaters. The immersive experience that makes it memorable also turns out to be a challenge in a public setting. Suppressing laughter or wiping away an unexpected tear in a room full of strangers became an unintentional exercise in self-control. While the film's ability to engage is commendable, I wish I had experienced it in the comfort of my home, where I could freely express every emotion without the constraints of social etiquette.\n",

            "Review: \"12th Fail\" is a deeply moving and inspiring film that captures the essence of perseverance and determination. Directed by Vidhu Vinod Chopra, this movie tells the true story of Manoj Kumar Sharma, portrayed brilliantly by Vikrant Massey, a young man from a small village in Madhya Pradesh who faces insurmountable odds to achieve his dream of becoming an IPS officer.The film opens with Manoj's failure in his 12th-grade exams, a setback that could have easily crushed his spirit. However, instead of giving up, Manoj embarks on a journey filled with menial jobs, sleepless nights, and relentless studying to clear the UPSC exams. His journey is not just about academic struggle but also about battling societal expectations and personal doubts.Vikrant Massey's performance is nothing short of extraordinary. He brings Manoj's character to life with such authenticity that you can't help but root for him. Whether he's portraying Manoj's frustration, helplessness, or unwavering determination, Massey does it with a depth that resonates with the audience. His portrayal makes you feel every bit of Manoj's struggle and triumph.The supporting cast, including Medha Shankar as Manoj's supportive girlfriend Shraddha, and Anshuman Pushkar as his mentor, add layers of emotional depth to the story. Priyanshu Chatterjee, in his brief role as the honest DCP, leaves a lasting impression with his powerful performance.Vidhu Vinod Chopra's direction ensures that the narrative flows seamlessly, keeping the audience engaged throughout the 147-minute runtime. The film's pacing is perfect, with moments of tension and relief balanced beautifully. The use of silent pauses and ambient sounds during critical scenes, especially during Manoj's final interview, heightens the emotional impact, making you hold your breath in anticipation.\"12th Fail\" also subtly addresses broader social issues, such as the importance of education and the corrupt practices that hinder societal progress. The film pays homage to legends like APJ Abdul Kalam and BR Ambedkar, reminding viewers of their call to \"Educate, agitate, organize.\"In conclusion, \"12th Fail\" is a must-watch film that leaves you inspired and emotionally charged. It's a testament to the human spirit's resilience and the power of dreams. Vidhu Vinod Chopra has crafted a masterpiece that will stay with you long after the credits roll.\n",

It actually feels like a real life story going on. We are so connected with each actor. Every actor even if the screen time is only 5-10 mins leaves a very big impact.The director covers quite a bit when he wants to show the struggle of becoming an IPS officer in India. He also shows that for a family who merely meets their means, how difficult is it to have integrity. But the the cast pulls it off easily.\n",

But what really stood out to me is the use of sound in this movie. There is no manipulative sounds like drum beats for intense scenes, but rather the director has used perfect background elements to create the intensity of moments. And then the soft humming of 'bolo na' song throughout the movie just added soul to this movie. Moreover, Restart and rap versions brought blood-boiling motivation in this movie. I am so impressed with this feature.Now speaking about the actor-actress selection---- just perfect! I mean, I have watched so many movies getting ruined for wrong cast, but this movie outdid this feature as well. Everyone just fit perfectly in their roles.The story is not new, a lot of indian movies have been made to show struggles, but still I cried so much while watching this movie.And finally the honesty that has been shown in this movie is also praiseworthy. Movies like this should come more often, to change the world.This movie will remain in my 'Touched my soul' movies list! Thank you all who were involved in making it!\n",

            "Review: If you haven't watched \"12th Fail\" yet, I highly recommend it. It's definitely worth your time.The characters' hardships and victories are successfully brought to life through the cinematography in an aesthetically striking way. When we look closer at the acting we can see how well the performers portrayed their roles. They have all put in a great deal of work to beautifully represent their personas. Their performances are sincere and convey a range of emotions that the viewer may relate to. Their performance gives the connections in the film a real sense which greatly enhances the overall impact of the movie.Massey takes the cake for delivering a brilliant performance, easily his career best so far. At every step, he brings a myriad of shades to his character. As a teenager in school, he is oblivious to the fact that cheating is immoral. As a struggling UPSC student, he is full of grit and determination and doesn't mind sleeping three hours every night to ensure he has enough time to study and do petty jobs for survival. Massey owns up Manoj's character in all aspects that you'd expect and performs it to the word T leaving no scope of any complaints\n",
            "Chopra has kept the dialogues simplistic, but they hit you hard and leave a lasting impact. He has effortlessly captured the vulnerabilities of the students who fail, fall and rise again. At the same time, Chopra has also touched upon, though briefly, the corrupt system that does not want the youth to be educated or reach a position where they can be in power and would act as a hindrance.\n",

            "Review: 12th Fail transcends its title, offering a gritty yet heartwarming portrait of overcoming societal labels. Vikrant Massey captivates as Manoj, a young man deemed a \"failure\" by a system focused on rote learning. The film doesn't shy from the harsh realities of social stigma and educational limitations, painting a poignant picture of struggle and marginalization. However, it's Manoj's unwavering spirit that ignites the narrative. His unconventional path to redemption - pursuing the prestigious UPSC exam despite failing high school - becomes a powerful statement against narrow definitions of success. Director Vidhu Vinod Chopra masterfully balances realism with heartwarming optimism, celebrating second chances and the transformative power of education. The supporting cast shines, enriching the story with relatable characters like the stoic police officer (Priyanshu Chatterjee) and the fiercely loyal sister (Mahima Mehta). While some narrative choices might feel overly sentimental, the film's core message - that dreams can bloom even in the face of setbacks - resonates deeply. Ultimately, 12th Fail is an inspiring watch, reminding us that true worth lies not in grades, but in the courage to defy limitations and carve your own path. It's a film that leaves you cheering for Manoj, and for anyone who ever dared to dream beyond the confines of a single test score.\n",

Also keep things in mind this movie will not provide you action not full of romance it will show you how friends and families play very important role in our life.So we always had to be grounded not to focus on unnecessary things that we raise our expectations too high for us, Also it teaches that if we fail in life that does not means we can not win, there is always a path for us either we will fail or we will pass, Life doesn't ends.And remember the dialogue of Sharukh Khan - Aagr happy ending nhi hui hai toh picture abhi banki hai mere dost.\n",

Starting from the storytelling including the Direction & screenplay to the acting spanning across the lead and supporting cast everything just fits in perfectly.Civil servant theme has been fairly used to concoct web series related to IAS/IPS by TVF, however it's refreshing to see that topic being navigated with so much of subtlety and finesse to bring out the painful and challenging journey some of the aspirants go through to achieve their goals.A must watch!\n",

Who will do what he has to decide to do?VVC created a masterpiece as previously he did.Through vivid characters, evocative visuals, profound writing, and a soul-stirring soundtrack, he crafts a narrative that resonates deeply. Vikrant Massey's portrayal of Manoj Kumar Sharma is a tour de force, embodying a range of emotions that leave an indelible mark. Priyanshu Chatterjee's portrayal of the upright police officer adds a layer of authenticity and bravery to the story. The film's exploration of discrimination and resilience is both powerful and poignant, shedding light on the stark choices faced by the marginalized. In every frame, Mr. Vinod Chopra's artistry shines through, turning moments into magic.\n",

Worth it to watch in cinemas.The way dedication and passion for such a prestigious exam has been shown is flabbergasting. Manoj kumar sharma is an inspiration for many. Shradhha, Dr. Kirti and his friends were the real supporters of him in his tough time. If a 12th fail guy can even think of UPSC, anything is possible then. Vidhu sir didn't disappoint us this time. No sexual content, no overrated drama and no cringe scene. Just pure and real life incident. India and the world needs such types of movies.Thanks to the whole team.\n",

            "Review: Within the landscape of silverscreen entertainment, there are but a select few cinemas that have the rare quality to caress ones soul in the most gentle of ways. The viewers are with left with an ineffable emptiness once the ending credits start to roll. Unsatiated with just what has been served you devour everything related to it in the hope that the blissful delight of viewing the movie persists. The hunger to understand and the desire to be with the characters leads you to the hallways of social media: reviews, discussion or interviews; just give me some more from where that came from. 12th Fail unequivocally is perched within this rarest of company.12th Fail is a poignant yet heartfelt portrayal of hope, grit and resilience. We begin in the rustic backdrop of Chambal, where Manoj Kumar Sharma (played by the excellent Vikrant Massey) is looking to clear his grade 12th exam so that he can land a job as a 'peon' and contribute financially to his near impecunious family. The opening scene gives a taste of what lies ahead, where Manoj is preparing 'chits' (notes) to be used cheat in the examination. Cheating in the village school has been a long established 'norm' by the corrupt politicians. However a newly deputed DSP Dhushyant puts a stop to practice. It is this encounter with DSP Dhushyant that changes the course of Manoj's life. In him Manoj finally finds someone to look up to, someone to aspire to be. It shows the value of role models in our life. How even the smallest act of someone unknown can correct the trajectory of ones life. It is at this point that Manoj aspires to be a DSP like his idol Dushyant and pursue the path of righteousness.Manoj encounters plenty of setbacks and tribulations along the way. However, the movie in classic Vidhu Vinod Chopra style, in a heartfelt manner shows the power of friendship and love in aiding realize ones goal. In Pritam, Manoj finds the most truest of friend who, despite his own struggles, not only introduces him to the world of UPSC but also helps him in every step of the way. Guri is a perfect mentor to Manoj who enlightens him on the value of resilience; there will be setbacks and failures but only those with the wherewithal to 'restart' can make their dreams come true. Shraddha and Manoj is a tale of love in its most serene form. Their story is an epitome of the transformative power of love and belief. Sometimes you don't find a diamond but help someone morph into it.Vikrant Massey delivers the best performance of his career. The of depiction of Manoj's pain and triumph is masterful. The climatic scene where he clears the UPSC and where he personally goes to deliver his wedding card to his idol Dushyant had me in tears and will personally go down as some of the best scenes in an Indian movie. Medha Shankar seems like a gem of find. It was also refreshing to see Priyanshu in the silverscreen after all these years. His brief yet highly impactful appearance adds depth to the narrative.The plot of 12th fail is quite straightforward. However its allure lies not in its unpredictability but its relatability. You kind of know what is about to happen. Nevertheless, it makes you curious as to how it actually plays out. It makes you yearn to learn how the characters experience the crucial moments in the movie. 12th Fail is definitely the standout Indian movie of 2023 for its celebration of the human spirit, deft portray of visceral emotions and an honest portrayal of the characters.\n",

            "Review: During this commercial film era, everyone wants to see higher box office receipts. Even so, not many movies are made with sincere intentions. They inspire us to go for our goals.I saw the movie 12th Failure today. I hope more Indians see these kinds of movies because they will inspire filmmakers to produce high-caliber, internationally recognized work. The Hindi cinema industry should be pleased of this movie because it fits into a certain category. I have to recommend this movie to everyone, but especially to students.The film does a fantastic job of illustrating accomplishment, hard effort, and purity in relationships.\n",

            "Review: So as a guy who wants to try his hands in UPSC, the movie was a ride, a ride to contemplate my decisions and prepare myself to face what is coming. The main character is so pure that even while working 15 hours gave a naive smile while saying \"Hum manage Karlenge, bhaiya\". Moreover, the movie is emotional about life, about the importance of society in success of anyone. It presents it beautifully that a person doesn't only need a partner to succeed but he/she needs a good milieu as well. Moreover, it also inspired to follow our teachers or role models whole heartedly just like Manoj did. Additionally, it also motivates us to fail, rise, fail and then again rise. To highlight the bad, I don't know what was it because I never thought and also I don't want to know because the good outshadows the evil.\n",

            "Review: A movie's influence on society is profound, capable of both deleterious and salutary effects. On the negative spectrum, films can perpetuate harmful stereotypes, propagate divisive ideologies, and reinforce negative behavioral norms. Cinematic content laden with gratuitous violence or explicit content may desensitize audiences, contributing to a coarsening of societal values. Such negative impacts can contribute to the erosion of cultural cohesion and the exacerbation of existing social maladies.Conversely, movies play a vital role in shaping societal norms positively. Cinematic narratives possess a unique ability to engender empathy, fostering a shared understanding of diverse perspectives. Films can serve as potent vehicles for social commentary, sparking dialogue around critical issues and inspiring collective introspection. Inspirational stories portrayed on the silver screen have the power to uplift spirits, instilling hope and catalyzing positive social change. Moreover, movies often serve as a mirror reflecting societal aspirations, struggles, and triumphs, providing a medium through which individuals can connect with shared human experiences.The cinematic oeuvre possesses a profound capacity to exert both deleterious and salutary influences upon societal dynamics. A film's deleterious impact manifests when it espouses pernicious ideologies, perpetuates noxious stereotypes, or promulgates deleterious values. Such cinematographic narratives can insidiously engender discord, contributing to the ossification of societal fissures and exacerbating extant socio-cultural malaises.Conversely, cinematic creations of commendable merit wield the potential to ameliorate societal mores. Films of probity can serve as a crucible for fostering empathy, galvanizing collective introspection, and precipitating positive social metamorphoses. These cinematic opuses become catalysts for intellectual ferment, fostering an enlightened populace attuned to the exigencies of societal harmony.In essence, the impact of cinema on society is a dual-edged sword, capable of both exacerbating societal ills and catalyzing constructive societal evolution. Discriminating discernment and judicious evaluation of cinematic content are indispensable in navigating the intricate interplay between cinematic narratives and their repercussions on the collective psyche.\n",

They show how middle class crack these exams and how much motivation they need but this movie shows that how lower cast achieve it with no resources.

Responsibility, poor household, love that can't be there, and a few more things. The movie was optimistic but not made up. It just felt like that one story in which all goes well. I was urging for a good happy ending at the new year eve and it gave me that. I started to see my story in it. At every point I was hoping ki Shaddha ki shaadi mt Kara Dena lol. It just makes me sad how both side of the story are so possible. Probably only part that felt a bit made up was the last interview round. And another made up scene that I didn't felt cheesy and I hope happens to me is where he went to meet his friend before the interview. The frustration in the eyes of the friend whose last attempt didn't clear was so real and sad but it wasn't sad amist the other happy endings. And I kinda feel that being friends with the main character, the friend will be able to live a meaningful life as well.\n",

Manoj's mother, by fabricating details about the household situation to shield her son from feeling overwhelmed by responsibilities, exemplifies the most genuine expression of love.\n",

            "Review: It would be an injustice to sing praises about this movie. The story and acting might come across as simple but it captures the true essence and angst of aspirants who are deprived of basic opportunities to grow and succeed in today's world. We're also shown the harsh reality of how difficult it is to get through the UPSC exams in India. Probably the most difficult exam in the world to make it all the way through. Vikrant Massey is a gem of an actor. Every one of the cast members have done a phenomenal job but it's Massey's show all the way, especially the last scene where he falls down to his knees portraying the culmination of every single hardship he's faced since he was born. We need more movies like this in Indian cinema.\n",

            "Review: Upon initially seeing the title, I anticipated a low-budget comedy film. However, upon completing the viewing experience, I found it to be a true hidden gem.Not a single moment is wasted on contrived comedic scenes or forced musical numbers. Instead, the movie maintains a seamless flow throughout.Every actor delivers performances that meet or exceed expectations, drawing viewers into each scene.What resonated with me most about the film is its consistent emphasis on core themes, particularly the importance of adhering to certain values and principles amidst life's trials and tribulations. Whether the narrative focuses on struggles or moral integrity, it leaves the interpretation to the audience.This film left me thoroughly satisfied, earning a perfect rating of 10/10 in my book.\n",

It's a struggle story of aspirants who want to achieve his success at any cost. It teaches us no matter from where you are, what's your condition you still have a chance to win. Don't lose hope and approve #restart moment in real life.12th FAlL is a BIG PASS with distinction.\n",

Must watch ... A clean and realistic movie .. A common man can relate this story with Vikram Massey and the character building has been done really well.Even the new girl has done a decent job for whatever she has got...Padma rani was excellent as uaual ... saw her after long time... priyanshu chatterji has a very small role but played it nice ... too of all Vikrant Massey is effortless ... he is underrated and deserves more .. some may not like but I would say he should get the best actor award for this year... but wait ... he has not been nominated in the film fair ... but ark has been nominated for 2 unbearable movie roles ....\n",

No fancy jokes or drama is required. You can still watch this movie for next two hours. Each one in the movie has done a tremendously well. All scenes are minutely crafted. Every detail has a purpose behind it. The focus never be on a single actor rather it has been spread across stars.Lastly thanks Vidhu Vinod Chopra for this excellent movie.

So, Yaa movie take start from the first scene.Talking about cinematography, its raw and natural. Like in one scene we see Manoj working in flour shop and on one side he is reading. We can relate to many scenes and can see ourselves in the movie.Screenplay is very good. We cannot get bored at any time while watching the movie. There are not many things to say about the movie because it just good. You should watch it. Vikrant messy nailed it. I can't even another actor playing Manoj.It's a good drama movie.

            "Review: THE BEST MOVIE OF 2023, period! This is a perfect example of how to take a movie with a strong and inspiring storyline based on true events. It portrays the crowd who has perseverance and never die attitude in pursuing civil services examination (UPSC) exams to eventually become IAS or IPS.Based on a real-life character, here is a chap from Chambal who doesn't pick up the gun when his father is punished for his honesty. He doesn't turn hostile when the local MLA stalls his wheels when he and his brother try to eke out a living. Instead, drawing inspiration from an upright police officer (Priyanshu Chatterjee), Manoj Kumar Sharma (Vikrant Massey) wields a pen and learns to write his own destiny in the allotted time so that he can also don the uniform and deliver the elusive justice. Cheating is a way of life in his surroundings but Manoj carries the righteous swagger imbibed from his father (Harish Khanna) and grandmother (Sarita Joshi).\n",

            "Review: There are very few movies that connect with their audiences so much that the viewers stop being a mere spectator and actually live through the emotions of the movie's protagonist. This can only be achieved with a meticulously well written screenplay of a story drenched in reality and relevance, directed with care and love and performed honestly by talented artists. 12th Fail is that rare movie where all these nearly impossible elements to achieve come together to create a masterpiece.Vikrant Massey is \"Manoj Kumar Sharma\" and by becoming this character of an honest common man with the ambition and hope to change the world without the knowledge and means to achieve the same, he has become the common man's hero of this era like Amol Palekar and Farooq Sheikh once upon a time. His performance is uplifting, heart breaking, infectious and pure magic. His supporting cast is real, sincere and exceptional.....His mother, his grandmother, his father, friends, mentor, interviewers etc etc.....all are real, sincere and truly exceptional.What Vidhu Vinod Chopra has gifted us this year is one of the most powerful movies of the year that will make us cry, make us worry, make us smile, make us hope and make our chests swell with pride and that is not something that many movies can achieve with their audiences. This is the kind of cinema that Bollywood's audiences need and definitely the kind of cinema that Bollywood's audiences deserve. This journey of a common man on search for meaning, hope and a better future for himself, his loved ones and his community is an emotional and moral triumph. For me 12th Fail is the best movie of the year and is a definite must watch.\n",

Very good storyline, amazing acting by everyone, superb direction, no faltu songs or overacting. Salman khan needs to see this movie to learn how to act. We need such movies where the content , acting, direction, storyline is all great.Vikrant Massey was excellent . He got into the skin of the character. Lovely to see Priyanshu Chatterjee. The dreams and disappointment in the acting and eyes of Aayushmaan Pushkar was awesome. It has depicted the true story of India's corruption and system, but shows that perseverance and hardwork is the key to success.\n",

            "Review: For me, \"Slumdog Millionaire\" was the latest powerful and successful work of Indian cinema. It was a film that could be watched multiple times. But this film assured me of the power and impact of Bollywood in world cinema. In a way that, after finishing the film, I was sure it would be very successful among audiences.I think this film owes its success to the intense empathy of the audience. In other words, the viewer sees themselves in the main character of the film in the face of a vast range of life events. From those who have migrated with the aim of studying, to an audience who has managed to achieve their goal in any way possible, everyone can place themselves in the shoes of the main character and personalize the screenplay in their own lives.Furthermore, the film's structure is astonishing. The director knows the audience and their expectations when watching a film very well. In such a way that the pace of events within the film, despite the long duration, is very enjoyable. Periods where important details are not significant pass quickly, and details are not paid attention to, while periods that are important and the audience likes to watch them are elaborately addressed.The actors, due to a complex selection process, are very capable. The presence of Manoj's friend, Pritam, is very heartwarming. Although it reminds us how fragile friendship can be and how love can be forgotten, the presence of this character is comforting and gives the audience a sense of reassurance.The love story that unfolds parallel to the film is somewhat unrealistic. Elements such as Sharddha's lack of understanding of Maroj's educational background and the passing of a series of issues between them are something that is rarely observable in reality, and the director has used this fact to make the audience feel satisfied.Ultimately, the almost flawless screenplay, precise and skilled actors, proper direction, keep the audience satisfied in confronting the film. Congratulations to Indian cinema.\n",

            "Aspirants, Kota Factory, Pitchers and Super 30..Why should someone wish to watch this movie.... So didn't I.... But day before yesterday while scrolling I got to see this in my list ON Disney+ Hotstar and on a second thought I started watching it... To be fair I must admit that I haven't seen Vikrant Messy either or not found memorable any of his performance..but As soon as first 10 minutes of movies and I kept my seat tight and complete it in just one seating (yes, many movies I have seen ON OTT with a daybreak or two).. To be very frank first I thought it's a prequel to Hritik's Super 30 as I found vikrant as Younger Anand Kumar of super 30..but then I revomed that thought from my mind and then I realised How Vikrant Messey had done so justice to his role of manoj from a small village of Chambal where almost every house has a dacoit living... It's a journey of him from being failed in 12th to become an IPS officer after failing 2 times in the Main exam. I am sure whoever has watched this movie must have seen himself in Manoj...This is the story about a boy of a village, where copying in board exam in every school is a culture and he was a part of it.l due to an SP who raids during running exams, catches this scam and the whole batch of that school declared failed..and then Manoj gets inspired that SP and passes his 12th in next year without copying.. How one boy from Delhi accidently meets him and helps him to get UPSC through.. His journey is incredible right from a 12th fail boy, then Aspirant and finally AN IPS.. Looking forward to see Vikrant Meseey in many such challenging roles...Special mention to Vidhu Vinod Chopra Sir for making such an inspirational movie... Its a must watch movie. Available ON DISNEY PLUS HOTSTAR.. Wishing all of u a wonderful year ahead...\n",

Pandey and mishra cone from social strata and have different priorities and prove maslows hierarchy right.Also this movie downplays the hype of coaching classes in a students life as most are farce.It is a gripping tale of aspirants from different walks of life trying to carve a niche and make their mark by attempting to clear the countries top most civil services exam.This also shows the rural and urban divide that exists. The director has tactfully written directed and produced a flawless realistic movie based on a true story. Khudos to all actors and this requires better movie promotions to and word of mouth.This will be a great blockbuster and a great motivator for regular students in urban centers and also a yardstick for rural candidates in the hardships they would have to face in order to get to the top most cadre in Upsc.... Hats off to all the actors and the makers of the movie..... A must watch..A classic vidhu vinod Chopra movie... You guys never fail to surprise and mesmerise the audience...\n",

Been a long time that i actually spect the entire duration of movie without skipping any thing. Last scene was a bit touching when he goes to meet the officer who set him straight in the beginning. Its a true story but director portrayed every thing in such a simple way. UPSC struggle is real. Lots os lots of aspirants are there. But struggle becomes bearable if you have a better companionship along the way who keeps you motivating to achieve your ambition. Its a classic movie all the way from beginning to end.

Jab chai Peete waqt bola ki chhod k jaegi Bhai aur ankho me Jo emotions the fir Manoj se ladai karte waqt I didn't feel if someone was even acting it felt so real. Family of Manoj was very fit into the character Manoj's father was amazing. I regret I didn't see this great great movie in a theater.\n",

The Vidhu Vinod Chopra film deals with the failures and successes of Manoj Kumar Sharma, who clears the UPSC test despite failing his 12th exam. Vikrant, in conversation with Hindustan Times, reveals what went into his prep work for the film, which is based on a true story. Vikrant plays a man from Chambal and had to lose and gain weight drastically for the movie. He shared, \"I lost 8-9 kgs within 3 months. But, the main challenge was to regain the weight in 1.5 months for the shoot. Khub gulab jamun, samosa khaye (I ate a lot of food).\"\n",

It portrays the crowd who has perseverance and never die attitude in pursuing civil services examination (UPSC) exams to eventually become IAS or IPS.Vidhu Vinod Chopra is a master story teller, and he sure knows to have the right blend of dialogue delivery with sensibility and delicacy.The \"HUG\" definition is shown as real and you can feel it.Screenplay is terrific with a touch of brilliance.Vikrant Massey's acting is a benchmark and he embodies it with full of life. His emotions, innocence, anger and happiness can be truly felt as he takes us through his tough journey to the pinnacle.Medha Shankar provides strong support for Vikrant. Their purest love, chemistry and just being there for one another when it's really needed is worth to withhold in your memory for a long time.Anant Joshi is the real friend one can wish for in their lifetime. Aisa dost sabko milna chahiye.Climax is multiple times clap worthy.10x respect for all those who pursued UPSC exams, tried multiple times and never lost hope. 100x respect for those who cleared the interview and serving for the government as the key administrators, and taking the country forward.This movie is a big inspiration for kids and future generation.

You can assume that may be it is your typical Bollywood masala film which will show unnecessary romance with spoonfed emotional dialogues and probably end with a shallow message. But belive me it's more than that. It's an complete masterpiece which followed one of the best hero's journey and set an example for upcoming bollywood films. The cinematography, editing, screen play,acting everything is just pitch perfect. Vikrant Massey,Vidu Vinod Chopra and every artist of this film who created such a heartwarming, inspirational cinema deserve a huge round of applause .Watch it and try to restart !Not a question mark but a statement.

They exploit the so called 'creative freedom' to make it more dramatic and take you away from the truth, thereby questioning how much was actually true.In this case, the WHOLE STORY is TRUE. There are no inspirations taken from real life. It is depicting the whole true life of Manoj and his wife Shraddha.Vikas Divyakirti is a renowned teacher. He is famous for his mesmerising and captivating style of teaching any subject. People of all ages find it incredibly hard to stop the video when listening to any of his lectures, which often go to 2-3 hours.Vidhu Vinod Chopra has carried the Bollywood with masterpieces from retro movies like 1942: A love story (famous for RDB's last compositions before death) to the recent masterpieces like 3 idiots and PK.His movies are worth watching and have set themselves apart from the entire industry.This movie will inspire you to do something big, get up if you have fallen down and RESTART.Manoj's true character based on honesty and integrity is also self-reflecting. You may also hear his interviews in Drishti IAS or Lallantop channel to know more. Both of which offer incredible details into his life and the impact of movie.\n",

            "Review: I was sceptical before watching because of Vidhu Vinod Chopra's involvement in this. Because during Shikara movie screenings, there were viral videos of him down playing the genecide of Kashmere Hendoos infront of a Kashmere woman who broke down in tears after watching his propegendu film. I am deliberately misspelling the trigger words so that my review makes it. So please bear with me.I also remember his flop film Eklavya which he directed too. But I was impressed by his direction skills in that movie. But the style of direction was completely different for 12th fail. It was as if a debutant director has directed it. There are no Bollywood style scenes of hero glorification, no Bollywood style songs, no cheesy repetitive dialog, no masala, no big names, completely different from a typical Bollywood movie. It felt like an independent low budget movie. It was like a breath of fresh air. They could've added big names and commercialised it but credit must be given for keeping the look and feel of the movie RAW.Every actor has done a great job. For Vikrant Massey, this movie was a curse in the guise of a blessing because his old controversial tweets are getting viral.But the movie itself feels pure. Vikrant Massey, all his personal flaws aside, has done a great job. You really are with him throughout his struggle filled journey and cry with him when he is successful in his attempt.Very low key but powerful movie.\n",

The meticulous attention to detail in character portrayal aimed to ground the story in reality, making it a poignant experience for many viewers. However, the emotional resonance of the movie is subjective, and while it may not have resonated deeply with me, I can appreciate the effort invested in crafting a genuinely moving tale. The film's ability to captivate an audience emotionally may vary, and it's clear that personal preferences play a significant role in one's connection to the story.\n",

This movie not only shows the reality but also shows the hard work of Manoj Kumar. This movie must be watched by everyone, it motivates you to do something in your life and it is worth doing.

Every scene is relatable somehow and not only to students but also for adults, it is mainly based on the hard work of a student who fails but never give up and now , is a respected IPS officer . I'm 100 % sure you'll love this movie .\n",

The actors did very well with their roles, you will feel never that they are acting and the direction is very appreciable. They showed us what people from villages who wants to be civil servant go through, it shows the real elements of village life, the amount of hardwork and effort they have to put to become something as compared to city dwellers. It is not just a one time watch and I recommend everyone to rewatch the movie whenever you feel low.\n",

            "Review: This is a perfect example of how to take a movie with a strong and inspiring storyline based on true events. It portrays the crowd who has perseverance and never die attitude in pursuing civil services examination (UPSC) exams to eventually become IAS or IPS.Vidhu Vinod Chopra is a master story teller, and he sure knows to have the right blend of dialogue delivery with sensibility and delicacy.The \"HUG\" definition is shown as real and you can feel it.Screenplay is terrific with a touch of brilliance.Vikrant Massey's acting is a benchmark and he embodies it with full of life. His emotions, innocence, anger and happiness can be truly felt as he takes us through his tough journey to the pinnacle.Medha Shankar provides strong support for Vikrant. Their purest love, chemistry and just being there for one another when it's really needed is worth to withhold in your memory for a long time.Anant Joshi is the real friend one can wish for in their lifetime. Aisa dost sabko milna chahiye.Climax is multiple times clap worthy.10x respect for all those who pursued UPSC exams, tried multiple times and never lost hope. 100x respect for those who cleared the interview and serving for the government as the key administrators, and taking the country forward.This movie is a big inspiration for kids and future generation. It teaches them and us that life can be restarted multiple times and can bounce back stronger.12th FAIL is a BIG PASS with distinction (Rank 1, 100/100, GPA 4.0).THE BEST PART FOR ME WAS THAT MANOJ AND MANOJ'S FATHER HUG SCENE.\n",

Why is she even in the movie except to add a love story to a non-romantic movie. And their love story is contrived and unoriginal. Her character is just present as eye-candy in the movie to attract audience, nothing else.It would have been better if her privileged upbringing was contrasted with Manoj's. Was even thinking of a split-screen montage in the vein of Better Call Saul to showcase this. But alas, let's leave it for the filmmakers who are true to their craft to the core.The journey of Manoj is good but could have been greater if the filmmakers wanted it. But, no, let's leave it for independent and arthouse cinema.\n",

However, if it's a movie that aims to be motivational and emotional, it might tap into the challenges, aspirations, and resilience of individuals who face setbacks in academics or life. A great review for such a movie might highlight its ability to resonate with audiences on an emotional level, depicting the struggles of a protagonist who faces academic hurdles and societal pressures and last offering a poignant message about resilience, self-belief, and the power of determination in overcoming obstacles.\n",

He is a well deserving talented actor but with less opportunities. As a big fan of him I always wait for his work. But this time I realise how valuable was this waiting. He got a brilliant story, a brilliant direction, a brilliant script and a brilliant bunch of co-stars. Well done everyone..Talking about Vikrant, this is the second time I've seen this kind of brilliant climax performance by Vikrant after the climax of A Death in Gunj. Not because of any lack of his performance but because he didn't got an opportunity to perform like this. Obviously he did a great job in Haseen Dilruba. But this, the whole movie, every single second of his screen time was marvellous. Hats off to a brilliant, much more deserving young talent Vikrant Massey.Along with him, the performance of each supporting actor Family of Manoj, Pandey, Shraddha and specially Gauri Bhaiya were outstanding. The whole team deserves every kind of appreciation and specially much more better opportunities to perform. Well done team 12th fail and All the vey best.!!RESTART..\n",

I love this movie and want India to make a lot of movies like this. This movie will inspire general people to reach the high. This movie is a symbol of dedication, motivation, love respect and patriotism... Well illustrated the picture of the current job market and the discrimination of social systems. The music reminds me Robi Sankar's Pather Panchali theme music. The film will be a benchmark in the Indian film History. Every actors and actresses did their job perfectly.

It is thought provoking, inspirational and sheer bliss.The actor actually took us in the roller coaster ride, and everytime he failed the audience felt the pain and when he finally became the IPS the audience felt that rush. This is called cinema. Pure masterpiece.This has to be nominated in the Oscars\n",

While having this topic of passing IPS exam can be very boring, director described journey very well.Vikrant was a perfect choice for the character. We have seen him before as normal guy, he did phenomenal job to justify the character.Movie is a must watch and probably one of the best from Vidhu Sir.I gave 8/10 just due to nuances of bringing little more time for love story where I felt movie was losing command. Vidhu sir handled is well, but could have reduced it little more to keep command on main character of Manoj Sharma.Watch it, after Dunki's disaster, you need this movie to recover. 😀😀\n",

I don't care about how much it earns in the box office, what matters is that it portrays the story better than most other bollywood movies could. It's certainly one of Vikrant's best movies. It is a pretty tightly plotted story, keeps you engaged throughout without any plot holes whatsoever. I definitely need to praise the actors. Honestly speaking, the entire cast did well. The emotions felt more raw, unfiltered and real instead of being nonchalant like other movies. Excellent screen-play and dialogue delivery, worth-while watching. Definitely a must watch for all the aspiring civil servants out there (including me). Vikranth Massey should keep doing more movies like this. Big thanks to Vidhu Vinod Chopra for amazing screen direction. I feel like Bollywood needs to deliver more movies like this. At the end I'd like to say, this a wonderful movie with excellent casting and screen play which won't let you down. One thing to note, don't miss the end part of the movie, it's definitely worth watching.My rating: 10/10.\n",

Great theme, highlights a really important issue. I rarely ever shed a tear while watching any movie or series but this film had me crying twice because the way you connect with the character, you start seeing your struggles in life and his each success and failure becomes meaningful to you. It motivates you to do better. Would highly recommend this movie if you have ever been through any kind of struggles especially if you are a student.

I loved loved loved how Dushyant Singh left an imprint on Manoj sir's heart, this is what kids in their teenage need. He said \"cheating chhodni padegi\" (you have to quit cheating) & he worked hard with all that he had, was contented, too mature at such an young age watch it guys go for it, this movie needs more and more recognition & remember \"haara vahi, jo lada nahi\"\n",

From the very first shot till the end, I was invested in the movie emotionally and mentally without realizing the longevity of the film's length. Talking about the plot, the story delves into very local and domestic areas which are often not highlighted. A story of success, motivation & not accepting failure is enough to motivate anyone to stand up and pursue what he dreams of. Even though there is a lot of inspiration from the classic gold \"3 Idiots\", this film takes a much more realistic take on the struggle of a student showing how it is to compete against the very privileged. It is something that brought tears to my eyes on multiple occasions which I can't say about a lot of movies. This movie makes me hopeful of the future of the Indian film industry knowing it will be in safe hands.

            "Review: I hope the Indian audience views such films as it will encourage film makers to do top quality work of international standards. This film falls in category that the Hindi film industry should feel proud of.A movie that definitely breaks the typecasting of Bollywood movies from the ongoing load of commerical, overhyped, over marketed movies coming out of the movie factory, that is Bollywood.Depicts a real life story of an UPSC aspirant (and the likes), the struggles year after year, the battle of resilience, and at last the judgement day. This will surely inspire many and will give morale boost to many aspirants and will give it's viewer to think after watch.Direction is superb and acting of Vikrant Messy is top notch.All Hail Vikrant Massey & Vidhu Vinod Chopra As They Shape The Most Pure, Personal & Brave Hindi Film In A Long Time.12th Fail deserves an audience, and we, as cinephiles, deserve cinema that respects us. Vidhu Vinod Chopra and Vikrant Massey have served one.\n",

The lead actor manoj kumar comes from a poor family. And how he struggles in his life to crack the upsc examination. Shraddha is another important character in this movie. How he helps manoj to crack upsc and stays with manoj is beautifully portrayed in this movie. Another character was manoj's friend. I liked that character, he also helped manoj in his struggle. Manoj's family was also very helpful.overall this movie was a good inspirational movie.\n",

Keeping everything aside, no spoilers, no drama, but this movie is a MUST WATCH for one's life!! Not just Vikrant, but every actor and the whole team NAILED IT!!This film proved that if a movie is made whole heartedly, not just to earn profit, then no matter how much the budget is, if the movie succeeds in the hearts of audiences, then no one can stop it from touching skies. Props to the director for putting forward such a story among all of us!!At the end.... It was a MUCH NEEDED FILM FOR BOLLYWOOD.\n",

            "Review: ## 12th Fail: Where Authenticity Burned a Bit Too BrightVikrant Massey's commitment to his craft in \"12th Fail\" is undeniable. Instead of opting for makeup, he truly immersed himself in the village life, spending weeks suntanning in a vest. This dedication even resulted in an actual sunburn, a detail left uncorrected in the film.In certain scenes, particularly the farewell to Dadi and the visit to Shraddha's home in Mussoorie, Vikrant's burnt skin is visible. This rawness adds an undeniable layer of vulnerability to his portrayal of Manoj, a character already grappling with feelings of inadequacy.Interestingly, Vikrant admits feeling underconfident due to the sunburn while filming these scenes. However, this insecurity paradoxically translated into an elevated performance. The visible discomfort mirrors Manoj's own emotional state, creating a palpable authenticity that wouldn't have been possible with mere makeup.While Vikrant's sunburn might be an unintended consequence of his dedication, it ultimately serves the film's narrative. It's a testament to the actor's talent and the director's willingness to embrace imperfections in pursuit of truth.\n",

And not just him but all of the cast members of the movie were so true to their character that you won't even feel that it's a movie and not reality.It is based on a true story of IPS officer Manoj Kumar Sharma. A man of honesty, integrity and high self esteem, who in spite of the many challenges of his impossible life, raised himself from being a 12th failed boy of notorious Chambal to become an IPS officer. He is currently serving as the Additional Police Commissioner of the West Region in Mumbai.Undoubtedly, it is one of the most relevant movies of the present time which grabs the audience's attention instead of wasting money and time on useless Big Banner movies of Bollywood.!!\n",

At many point of the time while watching this movie, you start feeling that it is your story.There is one place where the screenplay was not tight when the money of the film hero Manoj gets stolen by some stranger lady in the bus. How come a lady sitting on the window seat gets deboarded without a notice of the person sitting on the next seat? Except this plot, every moment of the movie is tightly scripted and does not bore anybody.Overall the movie is a complete family entertainer.\n",

Directed by Vidhu Vinod Chopra, it gives off vibes similar to 3 Idiots. Vidhu was one of the producers of 3 Idiots.I thought 'Dunki' would be like this, but 12th Fail surprised me pleasantly. Even with less money, it connects deeply, showing how powerful stories can be.This movie shows Massey's talent and Chopra's skill in making heartfelt stories. I really recommend 12th Fail. It proves that a good story matters more than a big budget.Rajkumar Hirani is pretty average without Vidhu Vinod Chopra. The man is a genius.\n",

And I'm sure that this movie will touch every heart of a BOY with Rural Background in which the father is the single breadwinner of your family and the whole family is hoping on that boy to break the chain of Poverty. Family is Fighting Every odds just to give that BOY the minimum financial support to his Success. Also the Boy is Giving his 101% towards his Goal. Every Difficulty that is coming on the way of that boy is facing with that one hope that one day I'll get that. And Usually in Rural India that Goal, that hope is to Get a Good Government Job that comes in the form of UPSC, SSC like Entrance Exams. This Movie shows that whole Journey of a boy coming from a small town. The boy is so innocent that for him getting a DSP RANK is all in his life. And then he discovers that there are lot of ranks that are the 'baaps' of DSPs. But like all the ASPIRANTS irrespective of their religion, race and caste they face failure. Now Facing Failure for son of that father who is earning enough to give him the other chance, the other Year is little Easy but imagine That Family who don't have that much financial freedom and are not able to fund that BOY. This movie is all about that Struggle that how he comes through out from all these constraints and becomes the inspiration and big booster to his Village. Everything from cast to acting is near perfect. Masterpiece From VIDHU VINOD CHOPRA.\n",

            "Review: Its a D grade copy Movie with world Class A performance by the lead actor.The movie screenplay , cinematography, and many cuts are cut to cut copy from too many web series and movies. Even the actor's shots are copies, but better than original. One of the best copies ever.Vikrant is world class A actor here.Script is average.Dialogues are average.Characters are average.Camera average.Casting is average.Everything is average about movie , except the performance delivered by vikrant massey. This guy has done more than extraordinary job , never ever seen by him, himself. Wont call a superstar yet, but one of the best actors in bollywood.\n",

            "Review: 12th Fail stuns you with its portrayal of dreams defying impossibilities, but let's be honest, we already knew Vikrant Massey would be phenomenal. This review shines a spotlight on the unsung heroes who made his path shine even brighter: the supporting cast.Priyanshu Chatterjee breathes life into DSP Dushant, the inspector who inspire Manoj. He's the backbone of the film, the quiet anchor who diverts Manoj's ambition. Chatterjee delivers a masterclass in understated emotion, his eyes speaking volumes even when words fail. His performance deserves every bit of recognition it can get. I am so happy to see Priyanshu in the movie!Anant Vijay Joshi as Manoj's friend Pritam Pandey is pure sunshine personified. He's the cheerleader, the voice of reason, and the narrator rolled into one. Pushkar infuses Pritam with such infectious negativity and positivity that you find yourself rooting for him just as much as Manoj.Anshuman Pushkar as the coaching institute teacher and friend is a revelation. He's tough as nails, demanding excellence, but his gruff exterior hides a genuine concern for his students. Joshi navigates the fine line between mentor and disciplinarian flawlessly and guides Manjo to achieve success.And then there's Medha Shankar as Shraddha Joshi, Manoj's girlfriend. Shankar's portrayal is a masterclass in resilience. Her unwavering support forms the emotional bedrock of the film.Vidhu Vinod Chopra deserves a standing ovation for his deft direction. He weaves a tapestry of grit, humor, and heartwarming moments, capturing the essence of struggle and triumph without resorting to melodrama. The editing mirrors the protagonist's journey, starting choppy and unfocused, gradually finding its rhythm, and finally soaring with confidence.12th Fail is a 9/10 must-watch, not just for Vikrant Massey's brilliance, but for the phenomenal supporting cast that elevates the film to another level. Go for the story, stay for the characters, and leave with a renewed belief in the power of second chances. You won't regret it.\n",

Movie, director and actor like this makes movie worth watching. I don't intend to write something which gives spoilers because I would suggest to watch the movie instead and restart your journey and embark on your success.

A life where aspirations are bigger than just making money. This movie values human emotions, true friendship and honest love beautifully.I wish this movie was made when I was studying. I would have watched it again and again to encourage myself to study more.Special mentions to the character artists in the movie too. They all played their small roles so well.Vikrant Massey is a consistent actor and he equally proves himself in this movie as well.Priyanshu Chatterjee plays the catalyst in the story.Last but not the least the storytelling of the movie is excellent and keeps us engaged. To portray human emotions there are tons of hugs.A must watch.\n",

            "Review: It is a movie that I cried in, that I will remember, and that I will watch again and again. The movie shares a few light messages - of how the success of one person in becoming an IAS or IPS officer is success of the community, of having a Never Give Up attitude (Haar Nahi Manunga), and most important, the core message of the movie: of getting up after failure, and starting again: #RESTART. The writing is great too, striking the right balance: gentle humor, underplayed emotions, and sentimental - but not over sentimental.12th Fail shows the the struggles that the millions of IAS and IPS aspirants in India go through each year, through the story of one person, Manoj Kumar Sharma, who goes from cheating in school in a village in Chambal to chasing his dream of becoming an IPS officer among the coaching centers of Delhi. The unrelenting optimism of Manoj, the protagonist, in the face of the most tragic struggles is depicted.\n",

He reads a letter written to him by Shraddha asking him to marry her. He happily gives the interview and comes out smiling. Two months later, when the results are declared, Manoj realizes he has got the rank to become an IPS officer and breaks down crying with emotion. One year later, he becomes a high-ranking IPS officer in Uttarakand to be with Shradda, and goes to meet DSP Dushyant Singh at the police station in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh to thank the DSP for encouraging him to give up cheating and gives him his wedding invitation card. Dushyant at first does not recognize Manoj but later is filled with joy on recalling fully and embraces Manoj for his success. The film ends as Manoj celebrates his wedding with his friends and family, finally having won against the tides of the cruel and competitive education system, with Pritam chipping in as the reporter, finally pursuing his dream.\n",

Every element of the movie was skillfully crafted, with characters, regardless of size, delivering their best performances, ensuring there's never a dull moment. As time races on, you'll find yourself rooting for the lead character's success.Notably, the film's strength lies in its compelling story and the outstanding performance of the lead actor, Vikrant Massey, who truly owned and conquered the role. It's disheartening that the movie struggled to gain attention pre-release, overshadowed by high-budget mediocrity like Jawan, Dunki, Animal, and even more disheartening that Netflix opted for a film like Annapoorni-a mere propaganda movie-over this gem.\n",

The scene where his results comes and he falls to the ground and cries just makes you go sentimentally exhausted and you forget that it's a movie and he is not Manoj but an actor. Vikrant pulled off entire movie with such ease as he was supported by excellent actors and director, rightly said by Vidhu Vinod Chopra that he made the movie not because of money, but he wants to contribute to the cinema.

The depiction of the IPS journey for Manoj kumar sharma is beyond words, the lead character has literally lived the movie. All supporting actors are masters on their own. I bow down to the makers of this movie and to the gentleman on whom this movie is based on.Every emotion has been portrayed beautifully, be it love, friendship, relationship with parents. The extent to which this movie is grounded in terms of showcasing the harsh realities of struggles of something like an IAS /IPS is commendable.\n",

            "Review: \"12 Failures\" is undeniably one of the most captivating and thought-provoking movies ever made, transcending the boundaries of conventional storytelling to deliver a powerful and resonant cinematic experience. The film's brilliance lies not only in its compelling narrative but also in its exceptional character development and masterful direction.What sets \"12 Failures\" apart as a cinematic masterpiece is its ability to delve deep into the human psyche, exploring themes of resilience, self-discovery, and the triumph of the human spirit in the face of adversity. The characters are portrayed with such authenticity and depth that they cease to be mere actors on screen; they become vessels through which the audience can vicariously experience a myriad of emotions.\n",

This simple realistic movie goes to prove that a great movie can also be made without scanty cloths or smooch scenes. I have no words to express how motivating this movie is for younger generation. Today when maximum kids in the city hardly know any struggle in life , when they are showered with everything even before asking... such movies can show them the reality .. can inspire them to a great extent ..can imbibe the values of Honesty and hardwork . While most movies are entertaining , very few have capacity to inspire and change the society in a positive way. This is one such gem.\n",

            "Review: 12th Fail is a recipe with lots of ingredients. Poverty, politics, corruption, friendship, love, and jealousy, to name a few. These are the ingredients that make up the life of an average Indian middle-class family.All these are rightly blended and perfectly complement the plots and sub-plots of this inspirational biopic drama about the life of Manoj Kumar Sharma, who is a 12th fail but aspires to become an IPS officer for the sake of his ailing grandmother and promises to redeem his father's principles when he decides to leave his village and prepare for the civil services exam in the most competitive neighbourhood of Delhi.It is a slippery ground when a director tries to handle so many ingredients at once. Yet VVC has done a tremendous job of balancing them so that none really overpowers the other. Although the plot is serious, the film is very enjoyable, with some light moments and comedy.The vibes of Delhi's Mukherjee Nagar must've brought nostalgia to many Indian youth and civil officers (or aspirants). Manoj and Shraddha's love story feels fresh and cute. Something seen after a very long time in Hindi cinema.The sound and cinematography is mesmerizing. Especially the breathtaking scenes of Mussoorie.Vikrant Massey is a fabulous actor, and these kinds of common man roles are just tailor-made for him. He is just a natural.There's a very special cameo from a highly influential person who has nailed his role to perfection too.\n",

This is what a Good Script, Direction and screen play is called - Which is a Formula for Successful Excellent film.The acting by all actors was so real and never loose their character or tune of the character from start to finish. All supporting cast were Bang on and ofcourse the Lead Actors were simply super superb, only our so called super stars could learn a bit of acting by watching such performance. Such an Amazing Amazing Direction and well Produced film by Vidhu vinod Chopra.The only part which I thought missed by Vidhu vinod Chopra was Human Emotion, Crying in Sadness, Crying in Happiness, (what we usually see in Rajkumar Hirani film), but it killed the last 15 minutes and wish we could see more of post officer work and his achievents.\n",

Every time I watch a movie of Vikrant Massey, it leaves me with a breath of fresh air of South-East Asia; home. From the first minute, I knew I was witnessing something amazing. However, nothing could have prepared me for the raw art that this movie turned out to be. All of the struggle, the dedication, and the fate of every character of this movie showed me a face that I can recognize if I walked a single street in India. I bawled my eyes out at the climax as if the victory was for me. In all honesty, this movie was a trophy made of diamonds for anyone fortunate enough to give it a watch. In all of the years of me watching movies, nothing has ever made me that emotional or connected. It is the first film that made me open a new tab and make an IMDB account just to give it a 10/10.\n",

Got the vibes of 3 idiots but still a lot more inspiring! The story beautifully portrayed the intense struggle and determination of a young guy, Manoj from a backward village; a character fueled with the power of self-believe. What brilliant level of acting with overall looks to portray his situation. Top of that the innocent love story added an extra tinge of respect and affection for the characters and overall plot. This movie deserves a big salute and heart-full love.\n",

Sometimes, from the comfort of our homes, we judge the world, thinking it's a good place with lovely weather today. However, perhaps for someone else, that world is a difficult place where they don't want to live, yet they persevere due to some weaknesses that always give them the courage to fight against this world. It's regrettable that people take such movies for granted and say, \"it's just a film,\" but maybe when you see every part with your own eyes, you'll realize that it's not just a movie; it's someone's world that once existed but is somewhere else today.10/10.\n",

            "Review: \"12th Fail,\" directed by Vidhu Vinod Chopra, is a compelling drama that immerses the audience into the world of struggles, ambition, and redemption. The film is inspired by real events and tells the story of a young aspiring student from a small town who dreams big despite the many obstacles in his path.Right from the start, the movie captivates with its authentic portrayal of life in a small Indian town. The cinematography effectively captures the essence of the setting, with the dusty streets, closely-knit communities, and the palpable tension between tradition and modernity. The director's eye for detail is commendable, creating an immersive experience that makes you feel as if you are a part of the protagonist's journey.The protagonist, Ravi Kumar, played masterfully by a relatively new actor, becomes the heart and soul of \"12th Fail.\" Ravi is a relatable character, embodying the hopes and fears of many young people who grapple with the pressures of educational expectations. Ravi's journey begins with him failing his Class 12 board exams - an event that becomes a turning point in his life. This failure is depicted not just as an academic setback but as a soul-crushing blow that threatens to derail his future.\n",

I like watching movies and I want such directors to come forward and make such good movies and motivate people and show good path so that they can learn something good from the movie.

            "Review: '12th Fail' is an Indian film from one of my favorite Bollywood writers, Vidhu Vinod Chopra. He occasionally directs, but I think he is a better writer than a director (he did both for this film, and both great). He has a reputation for creating outside-the-box films in a genuine, no-nonsense manner. It's refreshing to see talented writers like him focus on honesty, sensibility, and realism in a Bollywood that is known for the exact opposite. Films like these are what cinema should be about, no matter where it originates or who makes it.This film is based on a true story about a student, Manoj Kumar Sharma, wanting to turn things around for the better in a country filled with corruption and bribery. His father was an honest policeman suspended for hitting a corrupt cop, fighting the system in the courts. In the meantime, Sharma's family is suffering from poverty, so he and his brother start a rickshaw business, driving people back and forth for money. They have a dispute with one of the corrupt mayor's thugs. They get thrown in jail over a false accusation. Sharma, being a junior, gets released, and he seeks help from the Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), who frees them both from the corrupt policemen. Sharma decides to become someone powerful and also serve with honesty, like the DSP and his father. The film shows his journey and perseverance through one of the hardest exams in the world - UPSC. 200,000 Indians attempt it annually, and only 30 people become Indian Police Service officers after 3 rounds of exams.The brilliant writing, authentic acting, on-point directing, and cinematography are great. Bollywood films often have poor editing, resulting in scenes that drag on. Not here. The editing is very well done. The film went through 200 rewrites before the final product, which tells me special care went into this. Ultimately, it's a film about not giving up. I think the easiest thing one can do in life is to give up. One needs raw guts, determination, and willpower to fight in life, especially when the odds are stacked against them.Would I recommend this? Yes. The acting, the storytelling, and the reflection of realism awed me. Dreams don't come true by themselves. They are in vain until you apply dedication, utmost effort, and time to realize them.\n",

            "Review: 12th Fail\" features actors who may not be household names, but their performances are nothing short of outstanding. It's a testament to the fact that talent can shine without the need for famous faces. The movie, set against the backdrop of the protagonist's journey to becoming an IPS officer, is a compelling narrative that combines elements of determination, struggle, and triumph.The almost empty theater on the day I watched \"12th Fail\" left me pondering why such a brilliant piece of cinema wasn't receiving the attention it truly deserved. The answer, it seems, lies in the evolving tastes and preferences of today's moviegoers.Commercial films often come with extensive marketing campaigns and the allure of familiar stars. These factors undoubtedly contribute to the houseful signs outside theaters. However, it's important to remember that not every exceptional movie relies on star power or blockbuster budgets.\n",

I was somewhat intrigued by the real maoj Kumar'secture that upsc , exams and interviews are basically structured to find the utmost devoted to development of the country and are utmost deshbhakt uncorruptable officers. Yet some how I don't know we don't see them to often? What happens in the system? Who knows. But excellent watch. Highly recommended.\n",

Seriously, all the characters should get the best award and this film should also go for Oscar and the geat work of Vikrant Sir has done in this film.

            "Review: So, when \"12th Fail\" hit the screens, Bollywood was going through a phase of excessively violent action films, with unnecessary action, glamour and the objectification of women. Every flick I saw was a letdown. Sure, OTT platforms were churning out some good stuff, but nothing in the theaters made me go, \"Wow, this is it!\" I was starting to lose faith in Bollywood, to be honest. But then, \"12th Fail\" happened. No flash, no action, just a solid plot and killer storytelling. It had me hooked from the start. Even the credits were worth watching. At a time when mid-budget movies are losing their shine and fame it once had, \"12th Fail\" stands out. It's a beacon of hope for new directors and actors, and a reminder that relatable, everyday stories are here to stay. Okay, \"12th Fail\" might not be smashing box office records, but trust me, it's a must-see for any cinema lover. It's like, this is where the essence of cinema resides.\"12th Fail\" is just brilliant, the best part is that it doesn't force emotions on you. They just come naturally. Like, I recently saw \"Dunki\" and it felt like they were trying too hard to make me feel sad. Maybe it was the lack of character development, who knows. But let's not talk about \"Dunki\". Back to \"12th Fail\". The acting? Top-notch. The lead actor totally embodies the character and you feel like you're watching a real guy dealing with real struggles. The execution is just perfect. And yeah, it's a bit of a tearjerker, so keep those tissues handy.\n",

The movie doesn't merely criticize the system but also encourages viewers to question societal expectations and the definition of success.

Hats off to the director for presenting such an outstanding true story in such a fabulous way. We feel Manoj's character in every way. But the journey from UPSC aspirant to be an IPS office never be easy. You need support from your friends but you're damn lucky if you have partner like Shardha and friends like Gauri Bhaiya and Pritam. Medha as Shardha is damn good. She exist in this world is the most beautiful thing. I would love to appreciate the director Vidhu Vinod Chopra. The way he presented the difficulty of Mains is terrific. There is a surprising teacher in this movie for UPSC aspirants who is none other than Dr. Vikas Divyakirti, his words always hit hard. The most important part is the interview part. OMG, that is so good. How could you present that scene? Unbelievably brilliant. We can feel the tense environment and that nervousness in the mind of Manoj. The resulting scene genuinely made me cry. Especially the climax scene about the wedding card invitation that had Goosebumps. This movie deserves every appreciation. My hero Vikrant Messy deserves a national award.#12thFailReview 5/5*\n",

The performances are award worthy. Vikram Massey is outstanding in the lead role and is well supported by the rest of the cast. The direction, screenplay and editing are top notch. Unfortunately in India the over the top and illogical films become blockbusters and the really outstanding films don't do well commercially. I hope the Indian audience views such films as it will encourage film makers to do top quality work of international standards. This film falls in category that the Hindi film industry should feel proud of.\n",

            "Review: 12th fail is not just the same old underdog story which we often watch in bollywood, it packs in lot of different things effectively and efficiently. 12th fail has a runtime of 2 hours 26 minutes but never makes you fell bored for even a second. Director vishnu vinod chopra does a fine job in packaging various elements varying from romance, drama and many more in an interesting manner. Vikrant massey gives a career defining performance and stands out as manoj kumar sharma. He is expectional in places where his character is emotional vulnerable. Medha shankar is impressive in her debut. Anant v joshi does a fine job in playing a selfish and frustrated friend of the lead but Anshumaan pushkar as gauri bhaiya is a revalation in this film. Rangarajan the cinematographer of this film does a great work in encapsulating the vibe of the place which is filled with aspirations of people. The romantic angle between the two leads never makes you cringe fells more natural than forced. 12th fail is not just an ordinary tale it is a tale of resilience, determination and many more. It deserves your time and attention. 12th fail is impressive and on the other hand inspiring.\n",

            "Review: This movie is adoreable. It connects with the audience on a very emotional scale. It makes ordinary people like myself want to be a part of projects like these. It intelligently addresses some important issues in a country where society has a very dark, sadistic way of playing prosecutor, jury, judge and god without any accountablity. This beats all those utterly delusional bollywood actors, directors, scripts and screenplays that have a disconnect with real people and real issues by scores of miles. My kudos to everyone involved in a very meaningful, thought provoking piece of work. This is fresh! This is relevant! This is authentic! This is brilliant!\n",

            "Review: This is an eye opener for Indian cinema. Have seen Aspirants too which was about the same topic but this is one step above. All the characters seemed so real and are portrayed so beautifully. It will take time to get over this film. 12th fail is undeniably one of the most captivating and thought-provoking movies ever made, transcending the boundaries of conventional storytelling to deliver a powerful and resonant cinematic experience. The film's brilliance lies not only in its compelling narrative but also in its exceptional character development and masterful direction. What sets 12th fail apart as a cinematic masterpiece is its ability to delve deep into the human psyche, exploring themes of resilience, self-discovery, and the triumph of the human spirit in the face of adversity. The characters are portrayed with such authenticity and depth that they cease to be mere actors on screen; they become vessels through which the audience can vicariously experience a myriad of emotions.\n",

            "Review: Vikrant Massey didn't just act; he lived the character of Manoj. Along with Vikrant Massey, all other characters were phenomenal. It is a movie about how Manoj, who didn't even know what the UPSC exam was, ended up becoming an IPS officer. The detailing of the movie was really commendable - the songs, the dialogue delivery, everything was just perfect. You couldn't stop crying at the moment Manoj's result came out. The way Medha Shankar acted (Shraddha Joshi) was so real, and the way Manoj fell after knowing he had cleared the exam was so genuine. It feels like you won the battle of your own life seeing Manoj become an IPS. I won't give anymore spoilers here. A must-watch movie, especially for students preparing for competitive exams. I would have given it a 100,000/10 rating if that were possible.\n",

The screenplay yields a completely relatable narrative, squeezing every ounce of a drama from the rough and tumble of the man's voyages without resorting to any sort of excess. Sure, I can help you with that. Here's a review of the movie '12th Fail':\n",
            "'12th Fail' is a **top-class** and **must-watch** movie that will leave you impressed and inspired through almost every scene of its 147 minutes ¹. The movie is a **thought-provoking** version of the true story of an Indian Police Service (IPS) officer who failed his class 12 exams, did odd jobs, slept for just three hours each night, and started over four times to clear the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) exams ¹². The story follows Manoj Kumar Sharma (played by Vikrant Massey) and how he juggles menial jobs to survive while realizing his dream, with his mentor, friends, and girlfriend's support ¹. Every track in the film is a story in itself, from Manoj's misled youth where he doesn't know the right from the wrong to his struggles and restarting from zero each time ¹. The viewer feels involved in Manoj's success or failure. As the tension mounts when he goes for the final leg (the interview), silent pauses and the ambient sound makes you hold your breath, too ¹.The movie is a **gentle little film** that stays true to its purpose ². It is an **entertaining** and **inspirational** watch, with great performances ². The screenplay yields a completely relatable narrative, squeezing every ounce of drama from the rough and tumble of the man's voyage without resorting to any sort of excess. The movie also subtly touches upon why corrupt politicians want the youth to stay unintelligent, so they can be suppressed and ruled.\n",

In the absence of so called A listers, its the content of the movie which gets your attention. The struggle of IPS Manoj Sharma has been presented in such a way that each and everyone of us can get motivated. The Indian Cinema has been known to the world for presenting the human emotions in true form , the element which is lacking in current movies, however this one is an exception. Kudos to Vikrant Massey who has gone into the depth of character and surely joining the league of legendary actors in future. All the other characters have done outstanding job. Kudos to Vidhu Vinod Chopraji and his team.\n",

Manoj Kumar Sharma is from a poor family which lives in Chambal and has failed in his 12th exam. The movie has a very good storyline. Based on real story of an IPS officer. All the character have done well. Vikrant Massey is terrific as Manoj Kumar Sharma, and his earnest performance is one of the biggest assets of the film. Vikrant Massey got into the shoes of Manoj's character effortlessly and brought his A-game to the film. Vikrant Massey is nicely supported by Medha Shankar. How the real-life couple stood for each other through their thick and thin is well showcased. There are a handful of clap-worthy scenes in the film, but the best part was the final interview scene. Overall, like the movie.\n",

Then comes the electric zapper collar. Finally, my purple at-home collar is taken off and I know I'm going for a walk to the dog park. I'm so excited to see my friends. I hope Spike or Thunder are there already. They're the most fun to chase and tumble with. My human is pretty strict with me. I'm only allowed on the grass and not on the sidewalks. I think she's afraid I'm going to jump on the other humans. I don't understand why everyone else gets to jump on the benches and run wild on the sidewalks. They don't listen to their humans. I know I could ignore mine but if I do she may zap me and it's just not worth it. She probably wouldn't let me back at the dog park if I didn't listen to her. I just love the dog park.\n",

The challenges that the main character goes through makes him more than relatable as students sometimes feel as desperate or hopeless as him in situations. The perseverance of the main character also makes him a role model. The love interest for the character is well written and the lack of dance numbers makes her character fleshed-out and not an object. The supporting characters are crucial to the story as it wouldn't be able to progress without them and the relationship they share with the main character is natural. The cinematography of the movie makes you feel like the main character and the soundtrack further helps in that aspect. Overall this movie is a tell tale sign that Indian cinema will improve for the better and create many more masterpieces.\n",

There is something really special about 'underdog' stories. You inevitably root for your protagonist and champion his cause. But it's a premise that has often been under appreciated and over dramatised. Fortunately, in Vidhu Vinod Chopra's '12th Fail', the passion and emotions are aptly raw and refined.Based on a novel by Anurag Pathak, the film features the very versatile Vikrant Massey as Manoj Kumar Sharma, a young boy from Chambal who wants to join the police force. A 12th drop out, he wants to serve his nation and is prepping for the UPSC exams. His journey, however, takes a u-turn when he refuses to cheat in his board exams.\n",

            "Review: Must watch movie. This is not only a movie but inspiration for many aspirants . I request everyone to watch this movie. Vikrant Massey what an amazing performance. After Irfan Khan it is the first time I have seen such a real acting on screen. Keep doing such films. A movie that definitely breaks the typecasting of Bollywood movies from the ongoing load of commercial, overhyped, overmarketed movies coming out of the movie factory, that is Bollywood. It's trailer itself is eyepleasing, but believe me the entire movie is much beyond the trailer and the fact that it's based on true events make it one of the finest movies in the Indian cinema. The level of craftsmanship displayed in this production is truly remarkable.\n",

            "Review: So I watched this film a week back. But took a while to write a review because I wanted to watch this film again & again to see whether there was some emotional bias as the story was heavily relatable to a student like me or if the emotional prowess of the film had made me undermine the technical aspects of the film. Needless to say, after carefully watching again & again, now I'm even more impressed by the screenplay, cinematography, lighting, themes, direction & lastly the absolute masterclass acting by each & every cast of the film! People are talking more about Manoj & his journey and the romance in the film and of course I love it. But I also loved the performance of many of the supporting characters, where in one film the director, VVC, has managed to show other characters going through their own struggle, turmoil & has managed to extract raw, natural emotions out of each and every character. The BGM reminded me a lot of \"Pather Panchali\" by Satyajiit Ray & the lack of a powerful BGM and just going with simple humming, or even without any BGM in many impactful scenes has gone extraordinarily well with the context of the film. This is a masterclass and must watch for people of all ages all over the world!!\n",

The film's brilliance lies not only in its compelling narrative but also in its exceptional character development and masterful direction.What sets \"12 Failures\" apart as a cinematic masterpiece is its ability to delve deep into the human psyche, exploring themes of resilience, self-discovery, and the triumph of the human spirit in the face of adversity. The characters are portrayed with such authenticity and depth that they cease to be mere actors on screen; they become vessels through which the audience can vicariously experience a myriad of emotions. Go and watch.\n",

            "Review: Vidhu Vinod Chopra is a master storyteller when it comes to emotions. I feel the magic woven in Raj Kumar Hirani collaborations is mostly his input. I could be wrong, but this is just what I saw in '12th Fail.' I have watched it twice in a week now, and I cannot put a finger on it; it's too perfect. The soundtrack in the emotional bits and slow black fade-outs for transitions are reminiscent of legendary Indian cinema, might I say the Apu Trilogy. The life of Manoj Kumar Sharma is rife with ups and downs and is convincing me to read the source material. Probably after which, I would know how much of this movie is dramatized, but nevertheless, producing and directing a film that's thought-provoking, enjoyable, and relevant to today's political scenario is just what the doctor ordered. I really hope '12th Fail' travels more and wins more accolades for its efforts. Hats off to the actors for playing such convincing characters, leaving no eyes dry in the cinema. Vikrant Massey is definitely deserving (or \"dejerving\" as he says!) to take home all the lead actor awards this year.\n",

The story presented in a best way which makes you cry, laugh and enjoy at the same time. It's a struggle story of aspirants who want to achieve his success at any cost. It teaches us no matter from where you are, what's your condition you still have a chance to win. Don't lose hope. Everyone must watch the movie and get inspired to do something in your life. And achieve your goal. The Vikrant did the best job of his career potraiting a student with an atmost sincerity.Vikrant Massey's acting is a benchmark and he embodies it with full of life. His emotions, innocence, anger and happiness can be truly felt as he takes us through his tough journey to the pinnacle. Medha Shankar provides strong support for Vikrant. Their purest love, chemistry and just being there for one another when it's really needed is worth to withhold in your memory for a long time. Anant Joshi is the real friend one can wish for in their lifetime.Climax is multiple times clap worthy.10x respect for all those who pursued UPSC exams, tried multiple times and never lost hope. 100x respect for those who cleared the interview and serving for the government as the key administrators, and taking the country forward.This movie is a big inspiration for kids and future generation. It teaches them and us that life can be restarted multiple times and can bounce back stronger.\n",

            "Review: Undoubtedly, the most exceptional cinematic experience of 2023 unfolded before my eyes, and I deliberately saved it for the concluding day of the year. This film, in its entirety, flawlessly captivated my attention, with each succeeding scene surpassing the brilliance of the previous one. However, a poignant realization struck me-a lamentable truth that outstanding films often fail to garner the recognition they truly deserve, overshadowed by the glaring limelight of mediocre productions such as \"Animal,\" \"Pathan,\" and those formulaic Bhai movies.The juxtaposition of sublime storytelling and masterful cinematography in this cinematic masterpiece left me in awe. It serves as a stark reminder of the stark disparity between cinematic excellence and the commercial success dictated by popular but lackluster releases. As I reflect on this disheartening reality, I am compelled to acknowledge the ease with which we, as spectators, succumb to a cycle of complaint and discontent, especially when surrounded by the opulence and comfort that our world affords.The decision to revisit this cinematic gem is not merely an option; it is a necessity. A film of this caliber deserves multiple viewings, each unveiling a layer of intricacy and nuance that may have eluded me during the initial screening. Despite the industry's penchant for favoring commercial viability over artistic brilliance, I am determined to celebrate and support the creators who invest their creativity in crafting timeless narratives.In the coming days, I anticipate delving deeper into the nuances of this film, extracting meaning from its subtleties, and appreciating the artistry that often remains obscured beneath the surface. Perhaps, in doing so, I can contribute, in my own small way, to championing quality cinema and challenging the prevailing trend of prioritizing mediocrity over genuine artistic expression.\n",

This will motivate lots of new girl and boys to achieve their goal . I really want to ask everyone to watch this movie Clearing the coveted Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) exams is not for the weak, whether in academics or conviction. This makes Manoj Kumar Sharma's (Vikrant Massey) story extraordinary. The boy from a village in Chambal, Madhya Pradesh, flunks his 12th exams after the new DPS, Dushyant Singh (Priyanshu Chatterjee), prevents the teachers from enabling students to cheat in the 'borad' (board) exams. Manoj clears the following year in the third division and reaches Delhi to appear for the Civil Services examination. He has the fire but not the academic acumen to make it, so much so that he's not even aware there's such a thing as the UPSC or the IPS profile. The story follows Manoj and how he juggles menial jobs to survive while realising his dream, with his mentor (Anshumaan Pushkar), friends, and girlfriend Shraddha Joshi's (Medha Shankar) support.\n",

No exaggerations , nothing big in the movie but just the true struggles of Shri Manoj kumar sharma from nobody to a role model for the youth and rural population of India. The authenticity and reality of India and its political system truly reflects here. We need more movies like this. No vulgarity, no abuses , just a sime but beautiful love story. Medha Shankar played the role with such elegance and determination. \"Yeh ladai sirf ek ki nhi, hazaro bhed bakriyo ki hai\" , \"yeh log apne saath ek jazba lekar aate hai,ki yeh bhi ek din IAS , IPS banenge\" and \"haar nhi maanunga\" these lines touched my heart. Far better than those non-sense hook dialogues of movies. This is the movie which should have been in theatres . This is the movie that parents should make their children watch. This is the movie for the pampered youth of India reflecting the miserable life of rural India and the determination which defies every struggle. This is the real India where people go through the extreme worst to get the best!!\n",

A vivid portrayal of the struggles and challenges that large section of society faces and how exceptional talent just shines through. It is movies such as these which should perform at box office rather than stuff which is non-sense and completely divorced from real world.If you really love Hindi cinema - it is a movie not too be missed. Based on the reviews, I insisted that my 12 year and 8 year have to come along with us. We hardly take them for Hindi adult movies. My young kids were apprehensive and the younger one felt it is too harsh and violent in the start and yet both of them came out of the hall heaping praises and inspired that they need to overcome tough times and struggles to achieve something in life and make a change for the others. Kudos to the entire cast and team behind the movie.\n",

            "Review: A regret that could not watched it in cinema but watched it on internet. Amazing movie I liked it very much. I have no words to say. This movie is full of motivation and connected to many students life. It is not only a movie but a life of those millions of people who are poor or middle class, sometimes they don't have sufficient funds to purchase expensive books but they have determination. Even i can relate to my life. When a person is in his student life they don't have funds to dreams but when they become rich pr successful at that time they don't have time and dreams which thay have in their younger life. I think Indian government should give more scholarships to the students instead of relaxation in tax of millionair businessmen.\n",

            "Review: Great movie . Outstanding.\"12 fail\" is the best motivation movie I have ever watched. It's a top-class tale of grit and determination that will leave you impressed and inspired through almost every scene of its 147 minutes. The movie tells the inspiring story of an IPS officer who failed class 12 exams, did odd jobs, slept for just three hours each night, and started over four times to clear the UPSC exams. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a motivational story.In essence, \"12 Fail\" transcends the conventional boundaries of motivational cinema, offering a profound exploration of human resilience and the indomitable spirit required to transform failures into triumphs. I enthusiastically recommend this film to anyone in search of not just a motivational story but an immersive and emotionally resonant cinematic experience.\n",

            "Review: Title: Embracing Failure as a Stepping Stone: A Reflection on My 12th Grade ExperienceAs I look back on my 12th-grade journey, one word echoes loudly in my mind: failure. The mere mention of it might send shivers down one's spine, but for me, it has been a catalyst for introspection and personal growth. Contrary to society's expectations and the conventional path of success, I found myself facing the stark reality of a 12th-grade failure. In this reflection, I explore the circumstances that led to this setback, the impact it had on me, and the valuable lessons I extracted from the experience.The journey began with high hopes and dreams, typical of any student on the brink of completing their secondary education. However, a series of personal challenges and unforeseen circumstances began to unravel my academic pursuits. From family issues to health concerns, a perfect storm seemed to be brewing, threatening to disrupt the smooth sail towards graduation.As the academic year progressed, I found myself drowning in a sea of stress and anxiety, desperately trying to juggle responsibilities. The weight of expectations from family and society added to the burden, pushing me to the brink of my capabilities. Despite my best efforts, the impending exams loomed large, casting a shadow over any semblance of success I hoped to achieve.When the results were finally declared, the cold reality struck - I had failed. The initial shock and disappointment were overwhelming, and societal judgment seemed to intensify the pain. However, in the midst of this darkness, a flicker of self-awareness ignited within me. Instead of succumbing to despair, I decided to confront my failure head-on, viewing it not as the end but as an opportunity for a new beginning.One of the crucial realizations that dawned upon me was the importance of mental well-being in the pursuit of academic success. The relentless pressure to conform to societal standards had taken a toll on my mental health, leading to a burnout that ultimately manifested in academic failure. This realization prompted me to prioritize self-care, seeking professional help when needed and learning to balance the demands of academics and personal life.Additionally, my failure taught me the significance of resilience and perseverance. Adversity, rather than being a roadblock, became a stepping stone for personal growth. I embraced the challenge of retaking exams with renewed determination, recognizing that success is not defined by the absence of failure but by the ability to rise after each fall.The experience also reshaped my perspective on education. Instead of viewing it solely as a means to an end, I began to appreciate the journey of learning itself. The rigid expectations that had once dictated my academic pursuits gave way to a more authentic and intrinsic motivation to acquire knowledge.Moreover, the support of friends and family during this trying period highlighted the importance of a strong support system. The unconditional encouragement and belief in my capabilities fueled my resolve to overcome the setback. It reinforced the notion that success is not a solitary endeavor but a collaborative effort involving the support of those who genuinely care about one's well-being.In conclusion, my 12th-grade failure, though initially devastating, transformed into a powerful catalyst for personal growth and self-discovery. It forced me to confront the societal constructs that had dictated my path and paved the way for a more authentic and resilient version of myself. While the journey was fraught with challenges, it ultimately led to a more profound understanding of success, resilience, and the intrinsic value of education.\n",

            "Review: \"I recently watched a film that resonated deeply, serving as an inspiring guide for anyone facing defeat in their pursuit of dreams. This cinematic masterpiece, the best I've seen this year, boasts Vikrant Massey's stellar performance, complemented by Vidhu Vinod Chopra's formidable script and adept direction.Chopra, known for his collaboration with Rajkumar Hirani, steps into the director's chair with finesse, marking his 12th directorial endeavor. Despite previous skepticism surrounding his capabilities, this film dispels any doubts, offering a profound emotional connection that was missing in Dunky and some of Hirani's works. Vikrant Massey's portrayal is nothing short of remarkable, reminiscent of the performances Aamir Khan delivered 15 years ago. The climactic scenes, in particular, evoke memories of Aamir's iconic character Rancho. The narrative revolves around the lives of Officer Manoj Kumar Sharma and IRS Officer Shraddha Joshi, providing a captivating and insightful experience. In conclusion, this film is a testament to the brilliance of Vidhu Vinod Chopra Films. It deserves a standing ovation for its ability to touch hearts and leave a lasting impact. A must-watch for cinema enthusiasts.\"\n",

The cinematography appears to be a misguided attempt at avant-garde, with shaky camera work and bizarre angles that induce more nausea than artistic appreciation. It's as if the cameraman had a vendetta against tripods. The acting in \"Chronicles of the Absurd\" is a tragic comedy in itself. Wooden performances and awkward line deliveries make the characters feel like lifeless puppets in a poorly rehearsed play. It's a wonder if the actors even read the script before stepping onto the set.

            "Review: The way this movie has been directed is phenomenal. Just put your eyes on the hall scene where Manoj goes for the interview. When step by step candidates are going in the cabin for their interview and the scene which was created there was absolutely great.When is give the ratings on IMDB I actually talk about a little over acting from the actors. But I don't find any kind of over acting from any of the actors. I am in love with the story of this movie since I had already read the 12th novel.In 2021 when I was reading this novel I actually read in three parts. Because every page was so inspiring that I was thinking that why this noble has few pages. I wanted that Nobel to be ndy as I was actually enjoying a lot while reading. You know where Pandey says that I brought you here in Delhi and you didn't even know the U of UPSC, at least you should have asked whether I was able to crack or not. That was a remarkable scene. And when Shraddha comes at the place of Manoj where he used to work in atta chakki. Shraddha says that 'I have some money and Manoj interrupted her and says I'll manage don't worry ' you know these are the scenes that actually create great inspiration and motivation in someone's heart who has some guts to do something. I don't want to elaborate my feelings towards this movie.Appreciating this movie will not do justice with this movie because it is itself a movie which talks about itself. I just loved it. I'll never forget this movie and will keep taking motivation and inspiration from this. Thank you so much Vinod Chopra ji.\n",

I don't really wish to write so much about the movie. I really wish people watch this movie and get on to IMDB and post their comments here. The actor that played Gauri bhaiyya was inspiring as well. The dedication that he portrayed in favour of a guy that came from as humble background as his and the way he supported the guy is actually inspiring. I really hoped that I didn't have to write this much to leave a review for movie that deserves my best regards is very disappointing. I hope they make more of these kind of movies.\n",

Vidhu Vinod sir & Vikrant Messy should be awarded for the National award. As for as my review lies this is not a movie but a life struggle of many civil servant aspirants. I don't want to write anything about the story of MANOJ SHARMA SIR nor do I say anything about the movie because it's unexplainable. As I have read the book too.Every shot has meaning and this movie will certainly make you cry. I bet even a strong heart person may cry if he watches that movie. This movie has ocean of emotion and ocean of devotion. This movie shows that anything is possible for an ordinary human being if he has an audacity of hope and courage to achieve it. This movie teaches even an ordinary man can swim against the tides even in the storm.For me it's like all time masterpiece of BOLLYWOOD like SHOLEY,DDLJ,KKKG,BAGBAAN and 3 idiots.\n",

The story truly connect with the audience on different level as it contains all the parameters a movie lovers will look for even if it is based on true life story of IAS officer.It gives us all a great message about the life struggle, friendship, love and success.The most beautiful part is how director has took all the small details and gives a great meaning to the story like the classical musical bgm for the Manoj's character as he comes from small village and for shraddha's character the moden musical bgm for her wealthy character.This is one super experience with lot's of great notes a movie should be made.

The thing that I regret the most is that I did not go to the movie theater to see it and watched it after coming to ott. In my opinion, if this movie is sent to Oscar, it will win 10000% Oscar. The best thing about this movie is that it is a movie based on real story. Grandma, mother, friend, Bhaiya and Shraddha Oscar. And let's not talk about Manoj, even if he is not the main character, Shraddha has ruled everyone's hearts now. I would be happy if this movie could be re-released and made a super duper hit.\n",

The story has been told in such a heartwarming way that the audience is totally involved in this inspiring story of grit, determination and victory against all odds. The performances are award worthy. Vikram Massey is outstanding in the lead role and is well supported by the rest of the cast. The direction, screenplay and editing are top notch. Unfortunately in India the over the top and illogical films become blockbusters and the really outstanding films don't do well commercially. I hope the Indian audience views such films as it will encourage film makers to do top quality work of international standards. This film falls in category that the Hindi film industry should feel proud of.This will surely inspire many and will give morale boost to many aspirants and will give it's viewer to think after watch.Direction is superb and acting of Vikrant Messy is top notch.All Hail Vikrant Massey & Vidhu Vinod Chopra As They Shape The Most Pure, Personal & Brave Hindi Film In A Long Time.12th Fail deserves an audience, and we, as cinephiles, deserve cinema that respects us. Vidhu Vinod Chopra and Vikrant Massey have served one.\n",

            "Review: The film is a tribute to the spirit of perseverance and resilience that drives millions of students in India who aspire to clear the UPSC exams, one of the toughest competitive exams in the world. The film depicts the journey of Manoj from a small village in Chambal, where he falls prey to the corrupt system that prevents him from cheating in the board exams, to Delhi, where he struggles to survive and study while doing various odd jobs. Along the way, he meets his mentor, friends, and girlfriend, who support him and motivate him to pursue his dream.The film is a realistic and honest portrayal of the harsh realities and challenges that many students face in their quest for education and career. The film does not shy away from showing the dark side of the society, such as poverty, corruption, casteism, and violence, but also highlights the positive aspects, such as hope, courage, integrity, and friendship. The film also pays homage to the legends and icons who have inspired generations of students, such as APJ Kalam, BR Ambedkar, and Mahatma Gandhi.The film is driven by the brilliant performance of Vikrant Massey, who delivers a nuanced and convincing act as Manoj. He captures the emotions and expressions of the character with remarkable skill and sincerity. He makes the audience empathize with his struggles and cheer for his successes. He is ably supported by the rest of the cast, especially Anshuman Pushkar, who plays his mentor, and Medha Shankar, who plays his girlfriend. The film also features Priyanshu Chatterjee in a cameo role as the honest DCP who inspires Manoj to take the right path.The film is well-directed by Vidhu Vinod Chopra, who returns to his roots after a long gap. He shows his mastery of storytelling and filmmaking, with a tight script, crisp editing, engaging cinematography, and effective sound design. He balances the drama, humor, and emotion in the film, without resorting to melodrama or clichés. He also uses some innovative techniques, such as long takes, split screens, and voice-overs, to enhance the impact of the film.12th Fail is a film that celebrates the power of education and the potential of human spirit. It is a film that inspires and entertains, without being preachy or boring. It is a film that deserves to be watched and appreciated by everyone, especially the students and the youth. It is a film that proves that failure is not the end, but the beginning of success.\n",

            "Review: Definitely its more than 9 stars out of 10.It is going to be in my list of all-time favourite Indian movies.A film suitable for all ages.Everybody enjoys stories about the underdog, and we have seen a lot of them. However, the film's screenplay, directing, acting, and every other decision made throughout the process are what truly elevate it to perfection.Although the plot is predictable, the manner it was told makes it motivational.I adored the ensemble, especially his friends and family. Whether it is his mother asking \"Manoj\", \"If he will wear a police uniform...\" at the end, or his grandma giving him all of her money, their acting and delivery is so excellent and natural that they made me teary eyed.It is entertaining to watch \"Vikas\" sir make a special appearance.A special thank you to the director for creating this movie without sacrificing its intimacy to commercial appeal.I adored the writing; the dialogue complemented the situations and their emotion so perfectly. \"Gauri Bhaiyya's monologue skilfully arouses feelings without turning the circumstance into a sympathetic tale. The main character is not given any heartfelt dialogue to make him seem victim.Writing has some of the best lines include \"Jab kisi ek ka jeet hota hai.... or my favourite \"Their will is their wealth\".Shooting on real location makes the viewing experience authentic and relatable.The town and city were beautifully depicted, and the direction and cinematography are simply amazing. Especially the selection of camera angles and the lighting is perfect.The moment \"Manoj\" fell to the ground after knowing that he did it was so impactful, and seeing it from a distance captured not only his expression but also the reaction of his entire body.The camera pans out from a close-up of Manoj's makeshift vehicle to display the police, their van, and the arrest, indicating that Manoj has now left his small house and going into the larger real world.The music is performed beautifully. No matter how huge or small the scene is, it never overpowers it. The experience is enhanced by adding realistic sounds, such as people conversing, horns honking, and background traffic noise, during significant scenes rather than just a catchy melody. It was a wise move to forgo background music for the \"Gauri bhaiyas\" monologue.The narrative teaches you that success is not solely the result of your family's and your own perseverance; it also depends on the combined efforts of a \"Joshi,\" a \"Gauri bhaiya,\" and a \"Sharddha,\" as well as occasionally fate. How those in your immediate vicinity encourage you to try again after a setback.Choosing not to make the love angle the focus of the story, but using it to propel the story forward is not a typical Bollywood choice but thankfully they did it.It is not a usual Bollywood decision to use the love angle to advance the plot rather than make it the center of attention, but thank goodness they did.The fact that this film never tries to use its sad moments to make the audience feel sorry for \"Manoj\" is what I find most appealing. It keeps the whole thing positive and motivating. It never turns the main character into a victim of circumstance.Finally, \"Vikrant Massey,\" the lead, performed admirably. He gave an outstanding portrayal in every emotional sequence, including dialogue and body language.This film is a must-see for everyone and will win a national Award.\n",

            "Review: 12th Fail\" punches you in the gut with inspiration. Based on the true story of IPS officer Manoj Kumar Sharma, this film is Vikrant Massey's masterclass. He embodies Manoj's grit, transforming from a disillusioned teenager to a determined civil servant. The film doesn't shy away from social commentary - the struggles of poverty and an unequal education system add depth to Manoj's journey.However, some reviewers warn of potential pitfalls. The near-3-hour runtime might test your patience, and the portrayal of Manoj's struggles could be a tad simplistic. Don't expect a nuanced exploration of every hurdle he faced.Despite these minor bumps, \"12th Fail\" is a crowd-pleaser waiting to happen. It's a potent cocktail of emotions - heartwarming, thought-provoking, and undeniably uplifting. So, if you're looking for a film that reignites your inner fire and makes you believe in second chances, \"12th Fail\" is your ticket to ride. Just pack some extra popcorn for the long haul.\n",

            "Review: Beyond all the hype that is the Indian Civil Services exams, the movie's twin message that education is empowerment and honesty is rewarded in the end is laudable!I am unaware of the real life persona behind the chief protagonists of the film, but our family watched their story with tears in our eyes and positivity ebbing by the end of the film.This was a wonderfully well made movie both from story as well as acting perspectives. I am unable to recall the last time I watched a film devoid of cringe worthy scenes or raw action but still at the edge of my seat eagerly waiting for the next punch.Kudos to the team and crew. Please make more such movies that leave a positive message.\n",

            "Review: There were many moments where i cried, this happened after a long time. This movie connected so deeply, i think the director nailed cast selection, background score, direction and the actors did full justice with the movie. This is easily one in a decade movie.Vikrant Massey and his on screen family showed such raw emotions, i just felt I'm seeing something in person. The camera angles were brilliant. Thanks to Vidhu sir for not including any dance numbers or unnecessary songs. I hope India make more such movies, rather than over the top violent movies.I rarely write reviews, but the simplicity and brilliance of this movie encouraged me to support such movies so that we can hope to see more such movies in future.Thanks 12th fail team.\n",

            "Review: Well, for me it was such a inspiring movie. Each and everything of this film deserves being praised. First the narrative style is just so alluring; it's a story of Manoj but not in his own POV . This makes the audience even more invested in the story in my opinion. Then the characters... All the characters are played so nicely by the cast. The way they have depicted the characters in such a natural way is really marvelous. Oh! I must mention about the humors; I found the humors of the film entertaining. And then there is this sweet romance there. (I really wish to be ,at least to some extent, as supportive as the female lead of the movie)In my word, it's a movie where I was able to find practical life; it wasn't something too filmy. Director has depicted a story of an ordinary person's journey of becoming an inspiration for many other youths in an enjoyable way.\n",

            "Review: I always had that one thing for Vidhu Vinod Chopra as a producer after watching Munnabhai series, 3 Idiots and PK that this man knows the business of Cinema. Yes I had watched his previous film as director viz 1942 A Love Story and Mission Kashmir but it was those time I couldn't grasp those kind of cinema. Then I come across Shikara where I first noticed him as a director. And after watching his latest masterclass \"12th Fail\" . I can say with assurity that Vidhu Vinod Chopra is the man who knows business as well as the art. I just wish he works on more film as a director, we need people like him during this time delivery quality and out of league cinema as compared to topics of other cinema.\n",

            "Review: 12th fail is a captivating film that explores the journey of an unlikely hero, a 12th-grade dropout, as he navigates life's challenges with resilience and determination. The narrative skillfully weaves the protagonist's struggles, highlighting the societal pressures associated with academic success.The character development is commendable, portraying the protagonist's transformation from a disillusioned student to a self-made individual. The movie beautifully captures the essence of perseverance and the belief that success isn't solely defined by academic achievements.The cinematography adds depth to the storytelling, capturing the grit of the protagonist's journey through visually striking scenes. The soundtrack complements the emotional highs and lows, enhancing the overall viewing experience.While the plot may seem predictable at times, the film succeeds in delivering a powerful message about the importance of self-discovery and resilience. It challenges societal norms and encourages viewers to rethink conventional definitions of success. It's a must-watch for those seeking inspiration and a fresh perspective on personal growth.\n",

Those who have cleared the exams will enjoy watching the movie bringing back the memories of their struggles while they were preparing for the exams.All the actors have done incredible justice to each of the characters they portrayed.

It's like watching real life on screen. It takes you on a journey as if you're right there.Spoiler alert: The story starts in a small Indian village with a family of five struggling to get by. They don't have the same opportunities as others, like education or owning a business. The movie shows how people in power keep them down, crushing any chance of them getting ahead.But then comes our hero, who breaks through all the barriers and becomes an IPS officer, one of the highest positions in India.\n",

So this movie is inspired on a true story of an IPS officer in India. And for becoming IPS / IAS officer you need to qualify UPSC which is the toughest exam of india. The IPS Manoj Kumar Sharma even failed to qualify his secondary school exam in his first attempt and is from a village and poor family but went on to clear the UPSC exam which was his final and last attempt while failing his first three attempts. High on motivation, spirit! He legit balanced his emotional, professional, mental and family requirement and became a successful person.

            "Review: The dusty air hung heavy in the Chambal valley, a place where dreams seemed to dissipate like morning mist. Manoj Kumar Sharma, son of an honest clerk, dreamt not of following in his father's footsteps, but of becoming a beacon of justice - an IPS officer. However, the path to that dream was riddled with potholes, the biggest one staring back at him from his worn 12th grade admit card. Cheating was the norm, a tradition passed down like textbooks. Yet, fate intervened in the form of a newly transferred police officer, DSP Dushyant Singh. With an iron fist, Dushyant crushed the web of deceit, leaving a trail of disoriented students, Manoj included, staring at a stark \"fail\" on their results.Shame hung low in Manoj's village. Whispers followed him like dust devils. His father, suspended for standing up to corruption, faced an uncertain future. Driven by a newfound determination, Manoj decided to carve his own path. He and his brother shouldered the responsibility, their rickety rickshaw becoming a symbol of their resilience.One day, a chance encounter with DSP Dushyant Singh reignited the embers of Manoj's dream. Dushyant's unwavering honesty was a stark contrast to the corrupt world Manoj knew. Inspired, Manoj decided to confront his biggest failure - the 12th grade exam. This time, armed with books and a burning desire, he began a solitary battle. Nights were spent hunched over kerosene lamps, days filled with the rhythmic clanging of the rickshaw. Doubts gnawed at him, fueled by the taunts of those who believed a \"12th Fail\" could never succeed.The journey was arduous, paved with financial constraints and the ever-present shadow of societal disapproval. Yet, Manoj persevered, his determination fueled by Dushyant's words: \"Stop cheating to become an officer like me.\" Finally, the day of reckoning arrived. As Manoj emerged from the exam hall, a sense of accomplishment washed over him. He had not cheated, and that victory resonated louder than any score.12th Fail wasn't just the story of an exam; it became a metaphor for Manoj's fight against a rigged system. His journey, a testament to the power of unwavering spirit, proved that success wasn't defined by a single mark on a paper, but by the relentless pursuit of a dream. The narrative left a lingering question in the dusty air: Would Manoj conquer the ultimate challenge - the UPSC exam - and become the officer he always dreamt of being? The answer, like the future, remained unwritten, a testament to the human capacity for defying limitations.\n",

            "Review: \"12th Fail\" is a cinematic gem based on an inspiring true story. It's been a long time, perhaps only after \"3 Idiots,\" that I found myself wiping away tears twice in a movie.The story is beautifully told, drawing you into an emotional vortex. If you have ever faced life's challenges, loved deeply, had friends who made you believe in angels, if you believe in the inherent goodness of humanity, the power of hard work, and, most importantly, if you have ever faced a moment where compromising your values could fulfill your lifelong dream yet you choose to stand by your principles, then this movie is for you.Vikram Massey delivers a brilliant performance as the protagonist. He seamlessly conveys the character's pain, elation, love, determination, and eventual triumph. His performance is truly captivating.While not strictly a romantic movie, it has moments of romance that will give you goosebumps. True romance isn't about singing in gardens and grand gestures; it's about standing by your partner through thick and thin, even when logic suggests otherwise. It's about taking a leap of faith that transcends logic and enters the realm of pure emotion.The movie beautifully captures the essence of this kind of love, reminding us that even in the face of adversity, love can provide the strength and resilience to overcome any obstacle.If you're looking for a movie that will touch your heart, make you think, and inspire you, then \"12th Fail\" is a must-watch.\n",

It's despite simplicity, the film's honesty and relatability make it a worthwhile watch for those seeking inspiration and encouragement.As talking about student perspective it's portrayal of the struggles faced by students is thought- provoking.Also overall film's direction and performances are commendable, making it worth a watch for its relatable storyline and meaningful insights into the education system's flaws.

Many officer could not be able to crack this exams and failed in last interview. Good message to those, who really interested to change the nation and not need this post for self development. Beautiful message given at last, when manoj said that if he would not able to crack it, he will not lose hope. He will become teach and tell the students for stop cheating. Cheating is the small piece of big corruptions or crime. So hope whosoever really interested to change the nation will keep their focus on changing it. Good wishes to entire team of 12th Fail.\n",

Excellent casting , simplicity of screenplay and narration, very relatable. At no point in time does the film breakaway , or get distracted from the main story line, there are no side characters inserted only for filling screen time. All of them are very relevant. Vikrant Massey definitely deserves far more recognition than what he currently enjoys a highly talented actor. Vidhu Vinod Chopra clearly understands the nerve of audience , most movies of his hit that right vibe and still maintain simplicity which is a very difficult balance.\n",

Just beautiful!Every scene is tightly made. The actors fit the bill perfectly. Never once do you feel the need of a bigger name in the cast or a better direction. Spellbinding. The story of the sheer struggle associated with a economically backward person to rise up and gain respect and value in the society has been captured really well. It is a very tastefully told story which everyone should watch. Kudos to Vidhu Vinod Chopra on a masterpiece.\n",

It is true that one can achieve what he wish for if he is highly focus, dedicated and consistently working to achieve the task. Many times we don't realise how much pain one undergoes to reach to the height where they are today. The amount of struggle IPS Manoj has faced and inspite of that he has never lost his focus is something which we all should appreciate. Also, one thing which I really liked is that he never took help for free. He has always done hard work along with his aspiration to crack the UPSC.I can watch this movie any number of times. It will definitely bring tears in anyone eyes. Highly motivated and truly an inspirational movie. Now, I can keep Pursuit Of Happiness second on my list as this has become number one in my list. Thanks to the team for sharing such a motivational story with us. 🙏😊\n",

This movie is well directed and captivating.. although a wen series could include more details of his life and relationships but this movie still justifies to give audiance an image of what difficulties one has faced and how he still emerged a winner out of all that hardship. Truly inspiring and great performances..good to see Mr Charterjee as Dushyant Singh after long. Our industry must value the actors first rather than commercial success/stars.. that's when a worthy outcome will be seen..make movies not just bonker entertainment.\n",

            "Review: This film is engraved on an already awe-inspiring real life story of a boy from an extremely deprived background to become an IPS officer. Such a robust plot when moulded into a cinema in the hands of an experienced director and screenwriter creates a magic on the screen. Vidhu Vinod Chopra, the writer and director of 12th fail, has left no stone unturned to make this film an unforgettable experience.I have not enough words to praise the top-notch acting of Vikrant Massey, the soul of the film (Not to mention this is his career-best performance!!). All other actors have also delivered the applause-worthy performance. Background music is one of the best part of the film. \"Bolo Na\" song by Shaan and Shreya Ghoshal makes you emotionally charged throughout the film.The movie does not bore you with an overdose of unremitting struggle of protagonist. It has enough drama and thrill to bind you to the seat till the end. The protagonist's relationship with family members, classmates and love interest is also beautifully narrated. It is only in the very end, when you have tears in the eyes, you realize that you have successfully perceived the struggle and the message that director wants you to experience. I can go on if I describe the merits of the film, but I want to conclude by saying that '12th Fail' has successfully secured the spot in the list of Cult Classic Indian films.\n",

They could have shortened the movie.Also I am not a big fan of civil services exam and the candidates. I went to IIM Ahmedabad and cleared CAT in the first attempt, so I do know a thing or two about clearing competitive exams. From that perspective, I feel if the element of corruption is removed from the equation, civil services is an okay career and not a great career.In this genre, Kota Factory and Hindi Medium are more entertaining.Also given the stellar reviews and awards, the movie did not cross 100 crores in box office performance.\n",

Cinema which captures raw human emotion, an unfiltered potrayal of struggle, resilience, grit, determination, adversity & everything else that makes us human. It will keep your eyes glued to the screen for the entire duration. I'd missed the initial couple of minutes cause I was late to the cinema and had absolutely no idea that it was based on an actual person's story. Throughout the film I was absorbing it as fiction, thinking the writers took quite a liberty to with certain aspects. As the final credits rolled in, I was genuinely shocked. To think that someone had actually lived what was shown, was something which took a long time for me to accept. Caccooned in our privilege, it becomes imperative for us to know and learn from such lives, such people.\n",

            "Review: This is a tremendously inspiring movie based on a true story and a rare instance where the writers and filmmakers did not take creative liberties. What a tour de force.We live in a post-truth world where we can see real-time videos of atrocities being committed around the world yet those doing evil deeds lie openly and brazenly in public and private. The principle thesis of this film seems archaic and old-fashioned - that honesty is the best policy.Vikrant Massey is a genius actor who embodied the real-life character IPS officer Manoj Kumar Sharma's credo: \"We are all born with a divine fire in us. Our efforts should be to give wings to this fire and fill the world with the glow of its goodness.\" from A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, Wings of Fire. Seeing his undying fire restarting, again and again, was truly inspirational, repeated failures are not the end, but strategy must be improved otherwise we embody insanity.The absolutely gruelling process of the Indian Union Public Service Commission, with its multiple gates and circles in a game of snakes and ladders, is something to be respected and feared. Having gone through a shadow of those trials I can certainly relate. Ultimately as an elder stated late in the film, the point of the process was to select the bold and honest.Medha Shankar as real-life IRS office Shraddha Joshi is unparalleled and unequalled in the annals of women who believed in their men and inspired them to greatness beyond their own wildest dreams. She embodies loyalty, dedication, fearlessness and above all love that makes me want to stand up and salute. I am blessed to have such a life partner and I know what a difference it makes.This movie should make you want to be a more honest person, and to seek pleasure in the journey, picking yourself up every time you fall, and take satisfaction from playing the game honestly and avoiding cheating at all costs.\n",

Manjo was on the path of shortcuts until he met an honest police officer who inspired him to be better.

The direction, screenplay, and editing are excellent. It's unfortunate that in India, over-the-top and illogical films often succeed commercially, overshadowing truly outstanding ones. This movie, a source of pride for the Hindi film industry, hopefully encourages more high-quality work from filmmakers, reaching international standards.\"12th Fail\" is a refreshing take on the coming-of-age genre, offering a light-hearted and relatable portrayal of the challenges faced by students post their 12th-grade exams. The film strikes a balance between humor and meaningful moments, making it an enjoyable watch. The performances are engaging, and the storyline resonates with the audience, especially those who have experienced the uncertainties of life after school. While it may not break new ground, \"12th Fail\" manages to entertain with its charm and relatability, making it a worthwhile cinematic experience for those seeking a blend of comedy and nostalgia.\"\n",

Not any extraordinary story that we have never seen but the way it's presented and the cast with all the small detailings in the film will just hold you throughout the movie. You are left with lots of different emotions and motivation in the end. And to add it has a love that actually defines love. I regret after watching the movie that I should have seen it before with my partner, I will though. Some minor details of music like the instrument played behind both the main characters define where they come from. In addition there are instances when actors have sang song.\n",

            "Review: Finally, saw a master piece after a really long time. It's an inspiring movie but few things seem unrealistic. Overall, I will give 10/10 for this movie. It's about a guy taking inspiration from his situation and fighting hard to become IPS officer. I really enjoyed the acting and also no vulgarity or abusive language.Normally, a girl like Shraddha shown in the movie doesn't fall for guy like Manoj who has nothing and is so poor that he doesn't have his own room and is struggling everyday.Besides, that the movie was really inspiring. It takes a lot of courage to become an honest officer and I wish if they were respected more in India. However, they just get transferred more often than corrupt officers.\n",

V.: It is just an average film. Those who think that this is one of the best, I just want to tell you one thing -> watch Soorarai Potru and then decide. The scoring was not good too. In my point of view, I think that the actors haven't done an extraordinary work. I watched this movie with a lot of expectations, but at the end I was like \"Mmm, why people love this so much?\". It can never come even close to the film, i have mentioned above (SOORARAI POTRU) with the same genre as this film with an inspiring story (True story of a man named 'Nedu Maaran').

He got so carried away that his skin actually got burnt.Vikrant was quite worried but VVC assured him to not think about it.In the film, his burnt skin can clearly be seen in a few scenes - where he says bye to Dadi, and when he comes to Mussoorie to Shraddha's home. It was decided to not correct this in post production.Vikrant said that due to this, he was feeling so under-confident while shooting these scenes that it ended up elevating his performance, since Manoj is supposed to feel extremely low in the scene.\n",

It makes you one of the Manoj family and friends who desperately rooting for him to succeed.It has the right amount of drama, music and surprises which may not make very compelling on first watch but it is definitely rewatchable and please you with its ending.The story is based on actual incident but the execution itself is such good that it doesn't matter whether it happened or not.

The hardships, tragedies and the happy moments of Manoj made me cry almost five times throughout the movie. Not just wetting of eyes, tears literally flowed down my cheeks.The cinematography and the screenplay reached its limit for the Bollywood. The whole connection with the movie reminded me of Pather Panchali of Satyajit Ray. Yes I compare this movie with that of Satyajit Ray. His way of making cinema a work of art is reflected in the movie. So, Vidhu Vinod Chopra has done himself a lifetime of good.As this movie is becoming a sleeper hit, I would like to say something about Indian audience. Satyajit Ray once said that Indian audience is a backward audience, but the way today movies are received indicates that his opinion would have changed if he were alive. 12th fail is received with warm heart and is acclaimed on both theatres and on OTT. It is running in theatres for 10 weeks now. I regret watching on OTT instead of theatres.I would say that this movie is a must watch any Indian. This movie revived a hope in me for Indian cinema and I hope more movies are released which make me write this type of review. I heartily acknowledge the cinematographer Rangarajan Ramabadran and the director Vidhu Vinod Chopra.\n",

Our entire family has experienced myriad emotions and in essence this is what Cinema should be. Within few moments we were taken into the entire situation, immersion with each characters and their journeys , which each character has so beautifully crafted.While the world cinema has moved to violence, large sets, senseless action, icon worshiping.. here is a drama that is exhilarating and keeps you on the edge of your seat. We could connect to each character and how they would respond to every situation, the cinematography is so real and immersive that it made us part of the conversation. Each fail and restart (those who watched will get this) is such a powerful concept landed so creatively. After Broken Horses by the same director this one sets a new benchmark of cinematography. Hope to watch this again on big screen. Thank you all for the great work !\n",

I do read the actual book also, i don't think i have ever finished a book with in 6 hours of buying it. It was that good.\n",

Generally, movies are fantasy drive even in true stories but in this I got the near view of reality of every aspect like poverty, determination, never give up attitude, etc.Every movie has its merit and demerit points, but this movie made me blind that I can't find any weak point.In this modern era, most of youth are unstable, not determinate, Give up on early stage. This movie holds the power to teach youth that Never Giving Up attitude is essential to reach end goal.It was pleasure that I saw this movie with my family which is Worth of time.\n",

The film could delve into themes of self-discovery, perseverance, and the pursuit of unconventional paths, ultimately delivering a powerful and relatable message about the diversity of individual journeys.

The story has a very strong hold.From the dusty plains of Chambal to narrow loans in Mukherjee Nagar in Delhi, \"12th Fail\" isn't just a flunked exam, it's a battle cry for perseverance famously called \"Restart\".Vikrant Massey embodies Manoj, a young man who shatters societal molds, working odd jobs and in night studying textbooks for UPSC dreams.Chopra's lens doesn't shy from failure, etching its sting deep before celebrating the electrifying surge of second chances. Predictability melts away in Massey's eyes, each flicker mirroring the hope that fuels Manoj's relentless pursuit. Forget grades, \"12th Fail\" rewrites the definition of success, etching a poignant tribute to human spirit. Don't miss this raw, inspiring journey - every misstep a stepping stone to a triumph that transcends marksCo-written with 'Bard' the poet.\n",

Every Manoj rarely gets a shraddha to help in achieving dreams but this one is sure to keep. Music hits the right note even though it's not very much in the movie. Story keeps you glued through the screen and that's what movie is all about. You're eager to know what happens with every moving frame and this is what a good movie is about. Don't miss this!!\n",

How different love can be, how it can be fickle, irrational and self-serving. Often the cause of love is physical beauty, Shakespeare uses disguises and mistaken identity to show how misleading physical beauty can be.The movie shares a few light messages - of how the success of one person in becoming an IAS or IPS officer is success of the community, of having a Never Give Up attitude (Haar Nahi Manunga), and most important, the core message of the movie: of getting up after failure, and starting again:\n",

At no time does the director aim to create any sympathy for the protagonist.Amazing performances, each and every moment is crafted to perfection. The movie is currently the highest rated Indian film ever on IMDB. Planning to watch again and yet again amother day. Rate it at 10/10. Unfortunately my current favorite movie 'Kumbalangi Nights' has to move to second place.Do not miss this movie and make sure your kids watch as well.

And then, this one, 'Out of Syllabus,' surprised all of us with a very clean, entertaining movie filled with loads of emotions, inspiration, grit, and determination of a once 12th-fail student who went on to achieve his dream.A real-life story very well crafted on screen by Vidhu Vinod Chopra, and I must tell you, this is going to be memorable for those who watch it! This is the story of self-discovery, of how to follow your dreams, how to accept failure, and be a light for others, and the story of the importance of support from your family, loved ones, and friends.Vikrant, as Manoj Kumar, an IPS aspirant after failing his 12th, is phenomenal . Frankly, I had not heard of this actor, and he does stay in your mind for a very long time.Medha Shankar as Shraddha is simply outstanding and pretty! There are lots of other characters who will stay in your minds.It is not a one-man show; if it is so, then it has to be the director Vidu Vinod Chopra for keeping the movie very, VERY raw and realistic.Watched twice already and am sure my commute time will be \" RESTART RESTART\"All in all, a movie worth watching. EVERYONE CAN, and I feel, should watch!My rating: No surprises after a long post!\" 5 out of 5! See less.\n",

            "Review: This is the the most inspiring movie that I have seen. It has motivated me and I am sure will motivate millions to work hard to succeed in life. What makes it a classic is that it is based on a true story. I am from Delhi and have lived close to Mukharjee Nagar, where all the IPS and IAS aspirants study (the main location that this movie shows). I can feel the pulse. The movie makes you think about your life, about your own struggles and about what you can do for the young minds who never get the opportunity to study for their aspirations. This movie needs to be watched again and again so that we remind ourselves of our goals in life. I cannot remember any other movie that has touched my heart so much.\n",

            "Review: Thank you Vidhu vinod chopra, for making a movie which is truly needed.These are the movies which are to be made and wrote for people. Especially to this generation and youngsters who lose hope without any guidance. An inspirational and motivational. Directors need to learn how and what to be shown on the screen. Especially for the kids and youngsters to grow and learn how to pave their paths to become successful in their lives. Instead of making shameless and baseless movies promoting nudity and change of thoughts this movie comes outta nowhere promoting and letting people understand what's life and how one need to he still at what they do. I personally loved this movie because even I had a dream to be an high ranking officer. But no guidance, inexperience of life, laziness and self demotivation led me to self demolition. No spoilers revealed. But I recommend every parent to make their children watch this movie. These are the types of movies which would make and change their future and the future of this country. Ofcourse, cinema is a modern day teacher.\n",

Because of poverty and social suppression many intelligent and talented youngsters are having pavements to reach high levels in their life. They need support from someone to give a hand. If they get those hands, they will go to any hights. This message is beautifully illustrated in this movie. It also nerrates the emotional and circumstantial frustrations of modern youth. Romance, responsibilities, failures, ambitions all are laced with colourful frames. All characters are well spaced and artistically performed by the brilliant director. Songs need special appreciation with smooth editing. Congratulations.\n",

            "Review: It was Massey all the way like Messi led Argentina for the Soccer WC few years ago. States like Bihar are notorious for cheating in the exams. There are several centres where even the inviligators and teachers aid the students to pass the exam. For these students , passing the matriculation exam is the biggest achievement due to lack of proper education and infrastructure in rural areas. In such a scenario, clearing the UPSC exam for any student is indeed a harculean task. In real life too, many aspirants do not even clear the UPSC exam even after five or six attempts due to sheer competition involved. The way Massey displayed sheer grit , determination and perseverance in the movie was adorable. Certain movies should be made a part of school curriculum so that students need to be inspired by real life stories. Not many in Hindi movie industry get the opportunity to play a lead actor with such a strong script and Massey nailed it. The movie is definitely worth a watch with family and kids who dare to dream big in our country. Kudos to the entire team of cast and crew involved in this movie.\n",

Each person's performance was so perfect that it was embedded in the memory. The hero has always poured his all into acting. Naik's friend went to his friend's flour shop and the surprise performance was lively. The heroine's acting while singing was not acting, it was the shame of a fluent person's singing in a public place, the smile that mother gave while talking on the phone after headed he becoming IPS seemed that smile is come from the heart, the smile of grandmother when giving money was like a soul and Naik's smiling face after so much straggle is like a huge inspiration. At the end of my saying \"RESTART RESTART RESTART\"\n",

The cinematography, sound, acting, pacing, editing-everything is TOP CLASS.Vidhu Vinod Chopra is a master writer and director. He can take you through a journey of so many emotions; it's incredible.With the terrific acting of Vikrant Massey, I felt I was in his shoes. Not exaggerating. Medha Shankar, Anant V, Pushkar, all of them delivered great performances.I could feel the influence of the great Satyajit Ray's work on this film. The impressive long takes (which let the emotions build up naturally and feel raw) and the minimal use of music (inspired by Pather Panchali)... Satyajit Ray would be proud of this film.We NEED more of this in India. All I can say is, this film deserves national and international awards worldwide. A masterpiece forever.\n",

Based on the novel of the same name by Anurag Pathak, it chronicles the journey of Manoj Kumar Sharma from Chambal, who despite being a 12th drop out sets out to prepare for the UPSC12th Fail, as the title suggests, is a no-nonsense, highly gripping, and heartwarming real-life story of a student from a Hindi medium school in a remote village in Madhya Pradesh who failed his Class XII exams, and yet, stays the course, persevering through battles and failed attempts, to finally crack the coveted UPSC examination, and become an IPS officer.\n",

            "Review: I very rarely write reviews, but this one deserves one. A rating alone won't do it justice. This movie is various things: pure emotions, a story of dreams of millions of people, authentic characters and writing, mind-blowing acting, memorable characters, and a simple and relatable story at its core. The strongest contributor is is the story, so masterfully written, of course heavily inspired from true events. The characters of Pandey, Gaurinandan and Dushyant Singh in particular are so believable. Production is so top notch that the village, the library, the academies, every single thing has authentic written all over. Vikrant Massey has already established his status as a brilliant actor and this only confirms that. Medha Shankar is a revelation. She's got the simplicity and authenticity that was required for this role. Thus, she so excellently complemented Vikrant Massey.There are so many scenes that bring you to tears. So many scenes that stand out, like the one when Manoj first meets Pandey and Pandey accepts to take him with him. The best scene, as it tells about compassion, trusting a stranger and helping out selflessly. I think everyone can relate to it as everyone has in their life met someone who helped them selflessly, lifted them, without anything in return. Same goes for Gaurinandan's character. And of course Dushyant Singh as an honest officer inspiring Manoj is another highlight of the movie.\n",

The initial first half was very engaging, but the second half and the last 40 mins just swept me off. What a writing. The interview scene stands upon everything. Brilliant questions and the answers by manoj, mind blown. Shraddha is the girl whom every passionate man Long for. Her letter to Manoj just broke every fear of losing or defeat that made Manoj feel nervous/anxious. The way Gauri bhaiya just stood by manoj is the lesson I've learnt. \"IF U CAN'T, HELP PEOPLE WHO CAN\". Naval represented the flaws in every human being, but his redemption was heart whelming. I didn't mentioned any actors name who played the character, I've just mentioned the characters. That's what those actors doneto this movie. But I just want to give a bow to Vikrant Massey who played Manoj kumar Sharma, man who just rocked. Vidhu Vinod Chopra sir... I haven't watched any of ur films. But this one should your Greatest of all time. There is no technical or writing flaws to be mentioned. This is a kind of movie everyone should watch.

It is a story of a man's indomitable spirit under the most unforgiving of circumstances, a man's true uncompromising grit to pursue an almost impossible dream and not to give up his honesty in doing so! What's most compelling about this story is that this honesty was not very rooted in him, but once he understood that one can be successful despite being honest, he never gave up that quality. Along the man's journey through the grind of life, there is friendship, and there is love! I have not seen such a beautifully subtle yet very effective depiction of emotions in a love story in recent times. This is a movie made with a pure heart which is very well supported by honest performances. Vikrant Massey as Manoj is as convincing as it gets, Medha Shankar as Shraddha is refreshingly pure, the entire supporting cast is stupendously good...indeed this movie is a triumph of the pure!!!!\n",

And the fact that it's based on a true story makes it even more amazing! I'm at a loss for words to describe how fantastic this film is. Pandey was an incredible person who played a crucial role in Manoj's life. Without him, Manoj wouldn't be an IPS Officer today. Gauri Bhaiya was also a key person in Manoj's success. But let's not forget about Shraddha! She was such an important person in Manoj's life and an amazing partner. Everyone should aspire to treat their partner like Shraddha does. I salute her for her outstanding behavior. This film had a romantic vibe because of Shraddha, and hence the word \"Shraddha\" means Respect in English. Her name has been fulfilled because she truly respects her partner. I'm so excited for you to watch this incredible movie!\n",

So raw, so true, so grounded, you can get a whiff of earth if you take a breath deep enough. The characters are all well moulded, the camera angles are perfect. But it is of course the acting prowess of the main protaganist that stays with us. A real gem of an actor. Vidhu Chopra has created a real masterpiece. Now for the negatives. Using a narrator somehow takes away the punch, diluting the strength of the frames which can speak for themselves. Repetition of dialogues and scenes were also a bit of a put off for me personally. But all in all this is one movie that every school/college going person needs to see to be inspired, to realise what hard work looks like. Hats off to the entire team.\n",

Vikrant Massey you absolute beauty , incredible performance as Manoj Kumar Sharma , he lived as that character he became him all his gestures , style everything was on point (ignore me speaking like I know the actual Manoj Sharma but I have made the reel Manoj Sharma my idol that's all) . Medha Shankar was as charming and great in the film that I've already decided Aise ek ladki chahiya mere zindagi me aur koi nai. Geetha Agarwal Sharma as Manoj's mother was excellent capturing real emotions and making you cry through her performances. Harish Khanna who played Manoj's father was excellent aswell another great performances were of Anushman Pushkar RESTART!!!

            "Review: This movie redefines the typical formula for success in life , it shows the real India , ones struggle to do something coming from poverty-stricken background. Each frame of this not only captures the raw essence of one's struggle but also serves as an inspiration to never give up. Vikrant Massey lived the character and all other actors acted so well. Love plays a pivotal role in achieving success . The character of Shraddha says it loud that not every women is same, Some stand steadfast beside their loved ones, even in their darkest hours, believing in them when they themselves falter. Director gets the soul-starring motivating story with his direction, screenplay and camera movements.\n",

            "Review: I'm heartened to see Vidhu Vinod Chopra's production house stay true to its roots, refusing to get swept away by the recent wave of mindless, commercial Bollywood fare. 12th Fail is a breath of fresh air, a film that recaptures the essence of what cinema can be: gripping narratives, emotional depth, and characters that resonate deeply. It's a welcome departure from the outlandish action flicks and nonsensical comedies that seem to dominate the box office these days.Vikrant Massey delivers a career-defining performance as Manoj. The scene where he faces his family's disappointment after failing the exam is a masterclass in conveying heartbreak and vulnerability through subtle facial expressions and choked sobs. The shaky camerawork in this scene amplifies the raw emotion, leaving the audience feeling his despair firsthand.The film's ending, while predictable, offers a deeply satisfying emotional payoff. Manoj's triumph over adversity isn't a sudden stroke of luck but the culmination of years of relentless hard work and self-belief. The final scene, where he receives his UPSC result, doesn't rely on melodrama but conveys a quiet joy and the fulfillment of a hard-earned dream. This understated approach resonated with me more than any grand celebration could.\n",

Even with its straightforward title, it surprises us with the storyline that it follows from the main character's journey to turning failures into self-discovery. It feels real and relatable, showing how life can be unpredictable. The movie mixes in goals, motivation, and a clear message.

            "The emotional and inspiring journey of Manoj Sharma, an IPS officer, is depicted in this movie. It showcases his life from failing his 12th standard to clearing the UPSC exam in his last attempt. The movie begins by introducing the situation at a dacoit's den in Chambal, where the rustic people are portrayed well, along with a mix of good family emotions. It draws parallel characters of a father and son, emphasizing honesty. The movie also highlights the importance of education and how the values taught by it can make a difference in society. The best part of the movie is how it portrays love as a support system rather than a distraction in achieving big things. It is an inspiring story that makes us sympathize with Manoj and experience his pain and success. Every actor in this masterpiece delivers an awesome performance and truly lives their roles to give it life. The direction and screenplay are on point, with no unnecessary scenes. The movie focuses on showcasing the journey rather than the preparation and other stuff. If you ever lack motivation, this movie will surely inspire you. I strongly believe that education is one of the best weapons given to children to fight against society and make it better. My idea aligns with the message of the movie. Watch it, get inspired, and experience a rollercoaster of emotions.\n",

The characters are so relatable, it is almost impossible to not find yourself transported into that universe as if you are one of those characters going through the same struggles that the protagonist is going through.But then, that's what Vidhu vinod Chopra is know for.

What it requires to becoeme an IPS? What all trainging he has to undergo? Despite being from a poor backround, how he maages to acheive his dream, we get to see in this movie. Nice movie overall with a goos message. This movie has achieved to touch the heart of the audience. I like the voice an narartion of Anant V Joshi.

Raj Kumar Hirani took all the honors but relegated Vidhu to just a producer. 12th fail blow away all that and Vidhu is back with an extraordinary film that stays with you for long. He is a master story teller, starting in Chambal and then all the way to an emotional climax that is so endearing. 12th fail is a true story of Manoj Sharma and what a ride it has been for him. To immerse oneself in this tale, all credit goes to Vidhu Vinod Chopra. So many feel good moments, so many emotional scenes but no melodrama and great acting by Vikrant, Medha and others. The story, the characters, the pacing has been handled with maturity and the climax is just too good. The entire interview process is so crisp and the dialogues are just perfect! Nothing over the top! Great job Vidhu Vinod Chopra and an excellent movie, not to be missed!\n",

It could be counted as one of the best Indian movie of last decade. Perhaps we do need more movies like these that talk of education and support it instead of radicals depleting the countries potential by degrading education.

It portrays the crowd who has perseverance and never die attitude in pursuing civil services examination (UPSC) exams to eventually become IAS or IPS.Vidhu Vinod Chopra is a master story teller, and he sure knows to have the right blend of dialogue delivery with sensibility and delicacy.The \"HUG\" definition is shown as real and you can feel it.Screenplay is terrific with a touch of brilliance.Vikrant Massey's acting is a benchmark and he embodies it with full of life. His emotions, innocence, anger and happiness can be truly felt as he takes us through his tough journey to the pinnacle.Medha Shankar provides strong support for Vikrant. Their purest love, chemistry and just being there for one another when it's really needed is worth to withhold in your memory for a long time.Anant Joshi is the real friend one can wish for in their lifetime. Aisa dost sabko milna chahiye.Climax is multiple times clap worthy.10x respect for all those who pursued UPSC exams, tried multiple times and never lost hope. 100x respect for those who cleared the interview and serving for the government as the key administrators, and taking the country forward.This movie is a big inspiration for kids and future generation.

Vidhu Vinod Chopra's direction is a standout, capturing the essence of rural India and the stark realities of the education system with masterful precision. His ability to portray the contrast between the simplicity of village life and the overwhelming nature of city life adds a profound layer to Manoj's journey.As the director says towards the end\"No time to mourn dreams that are slain.Tears won't betray my heart's pain.No use to woe on.With a smile, I'll go on.Tell fate I'll return. Tomorrow is my turn!If I cannot be the sun that shines over the earth, I will be the lamp that lights the street.Broken strings play a melodious sound.A flower breaks through the stony ground.Spring and birdsong replace winters gone wrong.Morning rays bring a new song to sing.\"\n",

Definition of true love was depicted in the movie and it just looks like a fairytale but surprisingly it's a real life story. Meaning of friendship and support is displayed very carefully . This movie will inspire youth for many years in the era of mass movies a movie which just shows the struggle of a poor guy and brings back the audience to the real world hits just hard and on the other hand is very satisfying and real.\n",

His subsequent success in passing without cheating, clearing the UPSC exam, and becoming an IPS is a testament to the power of redemption and resilience. The storyline, based on true events, is both gripping and motivational, leaving a lasting impact. Personally, it ignited confidence and sparks within me. Without a doubt, a 10/10 rating on IMDb is well-deserved for this uplifting and thought-provoking cinematic masterpiece.Waiting for this chat to pin.\n",

Had to come from a genius like Vidhu Vinod Chopra.12th fail is a story of an honest family, an indian family that prides on doing things the right way. I would be surprised if this one doesnt make it to final list of National awards or even make it to the Oscar considerations.One of those movie that speaks to the inner you and not your emotions. Must watch just to see if honesty makes sense in the end.Not a love story, not a tragic one but one with honest depiction of strength and perseverance.\n",

Very motivational movie for an UPSC aspirants and all youth of India, I don't want to give a spoiler but saying in few words about the story, it's all about the struggle of a middle class boy who does not give up and achieve the dream. It shows very beautiful friendship and true love story as well. You can watch this with family members of any group age. It should be nominated for an Oscar as well. Direction is too much perfact and performance of vikrant Massey is outstanding. In the era of fake love story, cheating, bold scenes, movie shows strong bond of family, friends, and lover. We need this kind of movie in India cinema.\n",

A true depiction of a rural village family without stereotyping them as moster what bollywood usually do. Loved how director depicted the character of Dadi. An stubborn honest Vikrant Messy as a aspirant. His acting is something othe actors can learn from. The cinematography and music captures & delivers the essence of the story very beautifully. Its a proper cinematic triumph in every expect from Vidhu Vinid Chopra. He have shown if a director want he can made a movie without stereotyping villagers.\n",

A real masterpiece; i can't remember another movie so moving like this one, maybe Schindler's list; it makes you laugh and it makes you cry, yet it is so simple and straightforward. Maybe there lies its magic: no Hollywood superstars, no special effects, just pure emotions and feelings, love, fear, grief and regret, nostalgia for childhood and youth, memories of places and times that will not come back, memories of the loved ones. Some movies are there to entertain, some to scare, some to question. This movie is there to affect your feelings. Definitely to be seen.\n",

            "Review: I would like tell everyone that i have Mr. Manoj sir's story since long, when i read the book.But this movie is made way way too enormously good. From how an auto rickshaw comes and stops in the middle of the main conversation of blaming Shradha to how Manoj had hard breathing when he didnt have any answer.Not a single second is wated in this movie.Vikrant - You are a gem. Had been and have been. The effort what you have put in this movie is clearely visible. I can see your tan face and your lean body; hats off to you man....If you want to see a cult, this is the one.ELSE REGRET LATER.\n",

            "Review: The film meticulously delineates Manoj's character development, showcasing his unwavering commitment to overcome the obstacles strewn in his path despite lacking conventional academic success. His resolute nature and unyielding focus act as a beacon, illuminating the essence of persistence amidst the societal pressures and norms that often tend to pigeonhole individuals based on academic achievements.Through Manoj's character, the film masterfully sheds light on the broader socio-economic landscape prevalent in India, where the societal class divide often hampers the prospects of individuals like him. It resonates profoundly with the struggles faced by many from underprivileged backgrounds, navigating a system that frequently disregards their potential due to a lack of formal education or societal privileges.Manoj's journey serves as an allegory for the collective aspirations of the marginalized sections of society. His resilience not only symbolizes personal triumph but also serves as an inspiration, igniting a beacon of hope for countless individuals facing similar challenges. The film brilliantly portrays how determination and dedication can transcend societal limitations, empowering individuals to forge their paths despite daunting odds.The cinematic craftsmanship of the movie deserves recognition for its meticulous attention to detail in character development, storyline, and thematic depth. The director's vision, coupled with stellar performances, effectively captures the emotional and psychological nuances of the characters, offering a compelling narrative that resonates beyond the confines of the screen.\n",

            "Review: I watched this movie on Hotstar on the day of it's OTT release. The best part is that, I watched this masterpiece with my 4 cousins - one is in class 11, two are in class 9 and the other is in class 10, and each and everyone was fascinated by the idea of 'RESTART'. The sweetest part is that, we watched SRK's 'JAWAN' the previous day, and inspite of SRK's action packed thriller was able to leave the kids with awe, VVC was able to draw a thick line of motivation in their young and enthusiastic minds through his art. I have watched 'Aspirants' - the TVF made series related with UPSC preparation previously, but Vikrant Massey stands out with his acting. Ohh Lord!!! Such a performance!!! Perhaps the best from this year, he clearly depicted the real life struggle of IPS Manoj Kumar, through his eyes. The supporting cast - all the actors, most of the faces new, along with Vikas Divyakirti sir, are equally good.The movie motivates, and I will get back to it , when I need some, as I begin my preparation for the coveted exam this year.\n",

            "Review: Our whole family very much enjoyed this wonderful underdog story. It tells the story of Manoj Sharma, who overcomes incredible odds to become an IPS officer, a distinction that requires surviving an incredibly competitive examination and selection process in which only a precious few can prevail.Of course, there have been a number of fine films made about such underdogs, as it's an irresistible plotline. But this one also places a heavy emphasis on the importance of honesty and being true to your principles, even when everyone around you is not. The protagonist moves through a system that is awash in corruption; the local mayor blesses widespread cheating by students to get ahead, and allows the police force to operate on the basis of bribes and extortion. Minoj sees his father, an honest man, continually pushed around and essentially punished for his honesty, while others are rewarded for corruption. It is only when DSP officer Dushyant Singh arrives and demonstrates integrity -- refusing to allow cheating, refusing to bow to threats, and refusing to accept a bribe -- that Manoj sees the importance of uniting honesty and power, and resolves to achieve power by honest means, and deploy it with scrupulous integrity.From that point on, there are multiple examples of Minoj demonstrating his honesty even when it seems to penalize him. He alone refuses to cheat among his classmates, and gets a lower score as a result. He refuses to lie on behalf of an exam-preparation company, and forfeits his opportunity to work with him as a result. And I won't give away any spoilers, but the climax of the film involves an important moral choice, when telling the truth might cause him to lose everything he worked for.Amidst all the corruption and difficulty, there are a number of people who step forward with kindness at key moments: Pritam Pandey, a fellow aspirant who assists Manoj when he's robbed of everything he owns; a small cafe owner who offers him a free meal; Gauri Bhaiya, who dedicates himself to Manoj's success even after his own hopes are dashed; and a professor who not only teaches material for the main examination, but models the principles of integrity.It's an engrossing film and it delivers. Is it a perfect film? I can't say that it is; it gets a little hamfisted with its messaging, with characters delivering what amount to sermons at the viewer at key moments. There's not much subtlety, nuance or moral ambiguity here. But that's easy to forgive in a film that is a call for honesty in a corrupt world.Also, one quibble -- the song \"Restart\" is used relentlessly toward the end of the film. If you like it, that's fine. I didn't, which made the final half-hour and the closing credits a little more grating than they needed to be.Still and all, an excellent film! And a great film to watch with family, to impart the values of honesty, courage and resilience.\n",

            "Review: At last, the widely discussed Rajamouli curse myth has been shattered. While not the greatest feat, it's still a major victory considering the curse's track record and the film's stars' previous box office mishaps. Believe me, a 6-star rating is not to be underestimated, and \"Devara\" is certain to entertain and impress in parts and certain aspects!Devara is one of the much-hyped films of this year. From the commanding \"Man of Masses\" title card to the chilling stone inscription written in blood during the interval, the movie is a non-stop barrage of a killer background score. Anirudh's innovative use of the \"All hail the tiger\" motif in various moods is mesmerizing.I expected a decent commercial outing with the formulaic narrative to interval bang and pre-climax setup with a few high moments. The first half delivers on this expectation, offering a satisfying blend of cheesy crowd-pleasing moments and commercial masala tropes. It's like the slice you always reach for first.Unfortunately, the second half of the film doesn't live up to the promise of the first. It feels like a rerun of some old masala films, and the jokes are a bit of a miss. The comedy serves as overkill, and the female characters humor is like trying to laugh at a Nirmala Seetharaman's problem. The actress, well, let's just say she's of no use. You could take her out, and nobody would even notice.On the positive side, Anirudh Ravichandar's background score elevates many generic scenes. The cinematography in the first half is also a boon to the film. The climax twist adds an unexpected element to the otherwise generic narrative. And don't forget the long but decently staged action sequences, reminiscent of the ocean itself.And NTR? He is an absolute sea monster of acting talent. He shoulders the film throughout and manages to save it from completely sinking.To wrap it up, Devara is totally worth checking out if you're in the mood for a fun, mindless action-packed flick. It's got a killer soundtrack, amazing visuals, and JR NTR absolutely killing it.\n",

            "Review: Hits:1. VFX Surprise: Despite initial concerns, the movie's visuals (locations and VFX) impressed on the big screen, delivering a realistic and immersive experience.2. Action Masterclass: The film excels in capturing the intensity of mass action sequences. The ambush scene at the interval, with its blood-soaked waves and Devara's defiant face, is a prime example.3. NTR's Duality: NTR shines, portraying the duality of the courageous Devara and the timid Vara with remarkable balance.Misses:1. Second-Half Fumble: The movie's biggest weakness lies in its second half. Weak writing filled with immature jokes, illogical scene transitions, and a rushed plot significantly dampens the experience.2. Janhvi Kapoor Misfire: Kapoor's scenes were poorly received, highlighting some shortcomings in Indian cinema's portrayal of female\n",
            "characters.3. Music Overload: While the editing is good, Anirudh Ravichander's music feels overused, detracting from the narrative flow. The score dominates the film when a well-placed soundtrack would have been more\n",
            "impactful.4. Weak Dialogue: The dialogues themselves are forgettable, saved only by NTR's strong delivery.Uneven Pacing: The first half meticulously builds the world, while the second half rushes through the plot, leading to a forced and unsatisfying climax/cliffhanger. It feels like the director struggled with the ending, leaving it open for a sequel.Overall: A strong first half full of action and NTR's performance can't redeem a poorly executed second half. This film had the potential to be an epic action spectacle but ultimately falls short.\n",

            "Review: An Epic Masterpiece - Devara Delivers!Devara is a stunning cinematic experience that successfully blends action, drama, and emotion. Directed by Koratala Siva, this film takes you on a powerful journey that is both visually spectacular and deeply moving.The film's narrative is gripping, with layers of suspense and intrigue that keep you hooked from start to finish. NTR Jr. Delivers a powerhouse performance as Devara, showcasing his versatility and emotional depth. His portrayal of the character's inner conflict, along with the raw intensity in the action sequences, is simply mesmerizing.The supporting cast is equally impressive. Janhvi Kapoor shines in her role, bringing grace and strength to her character. Saif Ali Khan, as the antagonist, brings a menacing presence to the screen, adding a formidable layer of tension to the story.The cinematography and action choreography are standout elements of Devara. Each scene is meticulously crafted, with breathtaking visuals that immerse you in the world of the film.

            "Review: Right, so the plot's got a couple of clever bits, but then it throws in a few daft moments as well. The screenplay's not much to shout about either - some scenes are decently done, but a fair few are completely unconvincing, and the rest? Well, they're just plain dull.NTR, bless 'im, pulls out his usual stellar performance, but let's be honest, he doesn't quite look the part this time around. Saif, playing the baddie, gives it a good go, Prakash Raj did fine as always. Now Janvi? She's about as natural as a plastic plant - in her looks and her acting.The rest of the cast, fair play, they gave it their best shot. But the cinematography? It's bang average, nothing that really pops or feels authentic. The sets and props? Just as dodgy - it all feels a bit fake, to be honest. And don't even get me started on the VFX and CGI - absolute rubbish. Costumes and makeup are especially naff, especially on Janvi, who looks like she's just stepped out of a shop window.The music's decent, though, I'll give them that. But the action scenes? Overly violent and just plain daft at times.If you're a die-hard NTR fan, you might find something to enjoy in this less-than-mediocre flick, but for everyone else? Probably best to give it a miss.\n",

            "Review: Devara Part 1 is a great movie with a lot to offer, especially for NTR fans, as it marks his solo comeback after six years. The first half is definitely a highlight, setting the tone with engaging storytelling and building excitement for what's to come. The background score (BGM) stands out, adding extra depth and intensity to key scenes. It really elevates the emotions and brings the action to life, keeping the audience hooked.NTR delivers a strong performance, showcasing his range and versatility as an actor. His fans will undoubtedly be thrilled to see him take on such a powerful role. The film itself has a grand scale, and the water-based setting makes for an intriguing backdrop. While water-based scenes can sometimes feel limited, the movie manages to explore the environment in creative ways, doing justice to the plot. The action sequences are well-executed, with the water adding an extra layer of tension and unpredictability.One of the film's standout aspects is its visual experience. Watching it on the big screen is a must. The cinematography captures the grand landscapes and intense action, making every scene more immersive. The visuals complement the storyline well, making the movie feel larger than life.That said, there are a few CGI moments that don't quite hit the mark. Some scenes, especially involving water effects, could have used a bit more polish. While these CGI hiccups might stand out to a discerning eye, they don't detract too much from the overall experience. Given the scale and ambition of the film, the few CGI missteps are understandable and can be forgiven. The story and performances are strong enough to carry the film beyond those technical issues.The story itself is compelling, with well-developed characters and emotional depth. It's clear that a lot of thought went into the narrative, and it's not just a mindless action film. There are moments that resonate on an emotional level, particularly with NTR's character, as the film explores themes of loyalty, bravery, and sacrifice. These themes are woven into the action in a way that feels natural, making the movie more than just a spectacle of fights and explosions.The supporting cast also deserves a mention. They complement NTR's performance well, each bringing their own strengths to the table. Together, they create a well-rounded ensemble that helps ground the film, giving it the depth and complexity needed for a story of this scale.Overall, Devara Part 1 is an exciting film that's worth the watch, especially for fans of NTR and anyone who loves a big action movie with heart. The exceptional BGM, grand visuals, and NTR's powerful performance make it a must-watch on the big screen. While there are a few not-so-perfect CGI moments, the film delivers in its action, emotional depth, and character arcs. It successfully balances its ambitious storytelling with thrilling action, ensuring that audiences leave the theater feeling satisfied. If you're a fan of large-scale, epic action films, Devara Part 1 won't disappoint!\n",

            "Review: *\"Devara\"* is more of a one-man show, with Jr. NTR leading the charge. The film's biggest strength lies in its fresh setting and the impressive cast, along with some thrilling, well-crafted sequences. A major highlight is the spectacular ocean setting and a high-octane fight sequence that unfolds underwater, providing a visually stunning moment for the audience.However, the story follows a fairly predictable arc, especially for film enthusiasts who might easily guess the trajectory of the second part and the climax. The first half is dominated by the presence of Devara, the father character, making it clear how important his role is in setting up the protagonist's journey. The son of Devara, positioned initially as a \"loser\" in the story, is gradually revealed to be working behind the scenes, building up fear and tension in the antagonist's ranks.Despite the familiar plot structure, *Devara* offers a refreshing theatrical experience with enough engaging moments to keep viewers hooked.\n",

            "Review: Devara is a pirate living in a fictional(?) village called Ratnagiri along the border of Andhra Pradesh and Tamilnadu along with other pirates Bhaira, played by Saif Ali Khan, and others. During one of their pirate escapades things go south between Devara and Bhaira setting off a rivalry. Rest of the movie is about what happens to them and their rivalry and what role does Devara's son Vara plays in their relationship.The movie is all out NTR's movie. He carried the movie on shoulders despite being an insipid and predictable storyline. Screenplay by Koratala Siva suffers terribly in establishing the conflict and elevating the emotion to the right level. Action choreography and some important sequences leading up to the action end up being duds thereby rendering the entire action dull and boring and without a purpose. The movie reads like a 3 hour long exposition as narrated by Singappa, played by Prakash Raj, with bits of action set pieces thrown in for good measure.Cinematography by Ratnavelu is jarring sometimes even disrespecting basic shot rules in preserving the line of sight of the characters making it tedious to watch on the big screen. Anirudh's background music while decent, fails to deliver the emotional impact that the story demands. The presence of Jhanvi Kapoor is to deliver some \"eye candy\" and her only job is to seduce the young Vara and marry him. This is 2024 and I cannot believe big actors like NTR who got wide recognition for his role in RRR okay'd a script with cheap objectification of women.Writer and Director Koratala Siva failed to tell a compelling story of a leader and has the audacity to tell us to wait for part-2. Will it get made now is anybody's guess. If not for NTR, this movies would've been an utter disaster in all possible ways.--@CinephileIndia2023.\n",

Bit of forcefully I feel and similar to other kind of movie.Until then I feel the movie was going and expected something better than what I thought would be better feeling I had.But should credit the devara team for the scale of grand it few memorable scenes are there but revealing at the trailer make the scenes not much impact on me personally .It's good to see tarak after long time steals the show , Koratala one of my favourite director more expectations from his was also reason would be one of the disappoints for me .Overall Good 1 time watch for commercial movie lovers.\n",

            "Review: The first 40 mins is boring. The movie is entertaining after this first 40 mins.Jhanvi Kapoor is a cameo , she appears only in the second half only for a song and maybe 3 scenes after.Some scenes are interesting....esp on the Sea.There are a lot of long fights in the movie.The fights start from the first scene, and mostly, the fight scenes continue throughout the movie.Overall, it's an entertaining movie after the first 40 mins.The concept is unreal.. like 1 man is fighting and defeating 50 people.If this 1 man / hero comes , u can easily expect that he will defeat 50 people easily with visual vfx fight scenes and a background music.\n",

            "Review: If I had to choose between standing in the scorching sun for 15 minutes and sitting comfortably in a plush multiplex to watch this movie, I would opt for the sun without hesitation. The film was not only a complete waste of time but an absolute assault on my senses. Watching it felt like a punishment I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. This is easily the worst movie I've ever endured, and I say that with a lot of frustration. From its overblown action sequences to its illogical plot twists, everything about this movie was a testament to poor filmmaking.Let's start with the storyline-or rather, the lack thereof. It's almost as if the writers threw together a series of random events with no regard for coherence or flow. Nothing connected. The script meandered through a jumble of clichés and tired tropes, leading nowhere. Scenes were thrown in just for the sake of being flashy, lacking any narrative purpose. Characters appeared and disappeared without any real impact. And the dialogue? Cringe-worthy and stilted. It was as if they picked lines out of a trashy soap opera and slapped them onto a big-budget production.But the biggest disappointment of all was Junior NTR's performance. I've seen him shine in other movies, showcasing his talent and charisma, but in this film, he was completely overbearing. Every scene he was in felt exaggerated, to the point of being unbearable. Instead of delivering a performance that was intense and gripping, it was loud and melodramatic. It's almost as if he was trying too hard to be larger than life, and it just ended up being an eyesore. There was no nuance, no depth-just a string of over-the-top expressions and outbursts that did nothing to elevate the film. It was a massive letdown, considering the expectations people have from someone of his caliber.The supporting cast didn't fare any better. It's hard to even remember who they were or what they did because they were so poorly developed. There were side characters popping in and out, but none of them left any impression. The film kept introducing new faces without ever giving the audience a reason to care about them. It's as if the director thought that adding more characters would distract from the flimsy storyline. Spoiler alert: it didn't work.And then there's the action. Normally, good action sequences can redeem a film to some extent, but here, it was just a never-ending parade of chaos and confusion. There was no choreography, no creativity-just mindless brawls and stunts that made no sense. They were loud and gaudy, lacking any thrill or excitement. After a point, it felt like a visual onslaught, and I found myself wishing for the scenes to end. I was practically squirming in my seat, counting the minutes until the torture was over.Even the music, which usually serves as a redeeming factor in movies like this, was a complete letdown. Forgettable tunes paired with cheesy lyrics, and background scores that were more distracting than engaging. Every time a song started, it felt like the movie was being interrupted by a poorly-timed commercial break.The movie ultimately tried to be a grand spectacle but fell flat on every front. From the laughable plot to Junior NTR's over-the-top acting, it felt like a bloated mess of wasted potential. I've sat through bad movies before, but this was in a league of its own when it came to sheer agony. By the time the credits rolled, I felt drained and annoyed, wishing I had spent my time doing literally anything else-even standing in the blazing sun. At least the discomfort of the heat would have been honest and straightforward, unlike the forced, artificial drama that this film offered.So, if anyone's contemplating watching this movie, I'd urge them to reconsider. Save your time, your money, and most importantly, your patience. There are bad movies, and then there's this-the very definition of cinematic torture. Choose the sunburn. You'll thank yourself later.\n",

            "Review: Straight to the point, this script doesn't demand a budget of 300Cr and since they have spent that, the result is far from satisfactory.As with every Koratala movie, this movie has got no story, it's all about engaging scenes and few mass moments, sadly, here, neither the drama is engaging nor the mass scenes are adrenaline pumping. It just goes on and on and on....NTR's look as Devara is so underwhelming, didn't look fierce at all, no scope to showcase his acting prowess too, Saif Ali Khan gets a template role with worst dubbing work, Jahnvi gets a B-grade role and was irritating. Rest all star cast were criminally wasted.Technically, it doesn't give the vibe of a Pan-India scale, cinematography by Rathnavelu is surprisingly okayish, editing by Sreekar Prasad same, VFX and Production values are worst. Anirudh tried his level best to save the film, but no availableComing to Koratala Siva, don't know what prompted him to write a script amidst sea backdrop, it's just a template revenge drama, unnecessarily stretched for a second part. Direction too is underwhelming, so many scenes fell flat.\n",

            "Review: Apart from NTR action, everything else didn't work. Background music didn't click in first half. There are lot of elevation scenes but no emotional impact at all. Couldn't connect with story throughout the movie. Lot of scenes and setup looks like already seen before. Prakash Raj is a very good actor but his voice felt very monotonous and his getup didn't fit in at all. Same expressions and same highlighting the hero where it didn't needed etc. Not sure what's the role of heroine in the movie. In pre release interviews, so much talk about her acting, dialouge delivery but its all not true at all. Hope they don't burn the money with part 2. Final climax is a twist which doesn't belong to this movie. Directors Siva should've just did 1 part and put correct effort on that.\n",

The film is visually stunning, with a gripping narrative that keeps you hooked from start to finish.What truly stood out to me was NTR's performance - it felt raw, powerful, and incredibly immersive. He truly brought the character to life, and even as someone who isn't his biggest fan, I couldn't help but appreciate the depth he brought to the role.Devara isn't just for NTR fans; it's a well-crafted film that anyone can enjoy. Highly recommend it!\n",

            "Review: As much as I was excited for Devara Part 1, the film left me feeling underwhelmed, especially with regard to the female lead. For a movie that generated a lot of buzz around its casting, it's baffling why the heroine was given such limited screen time. What was the point of including her character if she's barely present in the narrative?To make matters worse, the villain's role is equally underwhelming. Instead of being an imposing or memorable antagonist, he comes across more like a comedian. It's hard to take him seriously when his performance feels out of place and lacking any real menace. A good villain is supposed to elevate the stakes, but here, it feels like a missed opportunity.\n",
